# Malicious actor can dos exercise of oToken if oToken guage is not registered on voter

## Summary

If oToken gauge is not registered on voter, as is the case for oFlow-V4, anyone can reset the gauge via updateGuage to the gauge "registered" on voter. Effectively DOSing exercises.

## Vulnerability Detail

As a result of the V4 upgrade the oFlow token no longer uses a regular gauge and instead uses a GasToken(eg weth) `RewardsDistributor` to distribute payment rewards (from exercising oFlow) to veLP holders based on voting power. `RewardsDistributorV2` can only distribute one reward token ,this means that the gauge (which is actually a `ProxyGauge` wrapping a `RewardsDistributor`) used by oFlow will be different from the gauge registered on voter for the FLOW/GASTOKEN pair as illustrated below.

## Impact

Anyone can DOS oFlow exercises by resetting the gauge after actual gauge has been set by admin.
