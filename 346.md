# Voting Power Manipulation through Merge and Split

## Summary
The VotingEscrow contract allows users to merge and split NFTs, which could potentially be exploited to manipulate voting power within a single epoch, similar to the issue described in the Spearbit report.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract includes merge and split functions that allow users to combine or separate their locked tokens:

## Impact
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1195-L1244

These functions could potentially be used to redistribute voting power in a way that allows for double voting or vote manipulation within a single epoch.

## Code Snippet
Users could potentially:
* Vote with one NFT
* Split or merge the NFT
* Vote again with the resulting NFT(s)
This could lead to inflated voting power and unfair influence over governance decisions or gauge weights.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
* Implement a mechanism to track voting history across merged and split NFTs.
* When merging or splitting, transfer the voting status and history to the resulting NFT(s).
* In the Voter contract, check the voting history of both the original and resulting NFTs when determining if a vote is allowed in the current epoch.
* Consider implementing a cooldown period after merging or splitting before the resulting NFTs can be used for voting.
```solidity
function merge(uint _from, uint _to) external {
    // ... (existing checks)
    require(!voted[_to], "destination already voted");
    voted[_to] = voted[_from] || voted[_to];
    // ... (rest of merge logic)
}

function split(uint _tokenId, uint amount) external {
    // ... (existing checks)
    voted[_newTokenId] = voted[_tokenId];
    // ... (rest of split logic)
}
```
