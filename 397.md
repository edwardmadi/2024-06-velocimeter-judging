# losing funds cause unsafe casting

## Summary
Unsafe casting from int256 to int128 in `VotingEscrow._remove_from`, `VotingEscrow._deposit_for`

## Vulnerability Detail
Casting `value` to int128 in `_remove_from`, `_deposit_for` could result in a loss of funds due to a shift.
in case of `_deposit_for` this will result in a smaller deposit value and in case of `_remove_from` this will result in incomplete removal of the set value from `_locked_amount`. 
When the user sends the correct `_value`:
`assert(IERC20(lpToken).transferFrom(from, address(this), _value));`

## Impact
Casting `value` to int128 in `_remove_from`, `_deposit_for` could result in a loss of funds due to a shift.
