# Blacklisted gauges are inflating emissions

## Summary

Blacklisted Gauges retroactively inflate emissions after they have been blacklisted

## Vulnerability Detail

Blacklisting is a process that takes time, and can never happen instantaneously

Due to this malicious users have the ability of possibly stealing emissions at no risk, if they have sufficient voting power they will also cause future emissions to be inflated

The `Voter` tracks `activeGaugeNumber` which is used by the `Minter` to determine how many tokens to mint

When rewards are above 1e16 (1%) of the total emissions, the Gauge is considered active and it will increase future emissions on the next `Minter.update_period`

Because blacklisting takes time, it is highly likely that a gauge that would be blacklisted ends up receiving rewards

Pausing or killing a gauge sets it's `claimable` to 0, but in the case in which `distribute` was already called, this would be a non-issue

## Impact

In this scenario, the gauge would no longer be votable, but `activeGaugeNumber` will remain set to a higher value than if the gauge was never allowed in the first place

This will cause emissions to be minted and distributed to other gauges, meaning that the mechanism is incentivizing users to create any gauge as long as it will inflate emissions

## Code Snippet

- Create a Gauge with a malicious pair, at the last block
- Vote on it with a VE or delegate that has above 1% of all votes
- Call Distribute on the malicious gauge

Emissions will be increased in the next mint because of this line:

```solidity
            if((_claimable * 1e18) / currentEpochRewardAmount > minShareForActiveGauge) {
                activeGaugeNumber += 1;
            }
```

The emissions are raised on week after, this means that a blacklisted gauge will raise the emissions amount while not receiving them

This creates multiple odd scenarios:

### Equilibrium Scenario

Imagine having the majority of the voting power, you would rationally want to maximize emissions to yourself

You would be able to do so by adding a gauge that will be blacklisted and voting for it

The gauge would then be blacklisted and the emissions would be distributed back to the "normal gauges"

### Spam maximization scenario

In the case of high vote power concentration, a simple scenario of spam voting malicious gauges would be used

By spam voting malicious gauges, emissions would rise, the malicious gauges would get blacklisted and the emissions would be sent to the bigger gauges

It's worth noting that losing 1% of emissions, while increasing emissions multiplicatively incentivizes these scenarios

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Blacklisted gauges should be checked to ensure that they did not raise the `activeGaugeNumber`

If they did, then `activeGaugeNumber` should be deducted
