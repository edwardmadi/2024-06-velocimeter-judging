# Attacker can bypass ownership change protection in `VotingEscrow::split()` and `VotingEscrow::merge()`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `VotingEscrow` contract implements a protection mechanism against rapid ownership changes and potential flash loan attacks through the [`ownership_change`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L226) mapping. This mapping records the block number of the last ownership change for each token. However, this protection is inconsistently applied across the contract's functions.

The [`_transferFrom()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L315-L342) correctly updates the `ownership_change` mapping:

```solidity
function _transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _tokenId, address _sender) internal {
    // ... other code ...
    ownership_change[_tokenId] = block.number;
    // ... other code ...
}
```

However, the [`split()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1217-L1244) and [`merge()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1195-L1210) functions, which also affect token ownership, fail to update this mapping:

```solidity
function split(uint _tokenId, uint amount) external {
    // ... other code ...
    _remove_from(_tokenId, amount, unlock_time, _locked);
    // No update to ownership_change
    // ... other code ...
}

function merge(uint _from, uint _to) external {
    // ... other code ...
    _checkpoint(_from, _locked0, LockedBalance(0, 0));
    _burn(_from);
    // No update to ownership_change
    // ... other code ...
}
```

This inconsistency creates a vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate token ownership without triggering the intended protection mechanism. By using the `split()` and `merge()` functions, an attacker can effectively change token ownership or create new tokens without updating the `ownership_change` mapping, potentially bypassing security checks that rely on this information.

## Impact
The bypass of the `ownership_change` protection mechanism could lead to unexpected behavior in other parts of the system that rely on this information for security checks. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited in combination with other contract functions to perform actions that should be restricted based on ownership change timing. 


## Proof of Concept
1. Attacker identifies a token with a recent `ownership_change` timestamp.
2. Attacker calls `split()` on this token, creating a new token without updating `ownership_change`.
3. Attacker immediately uses the new token in a function that checks `ownership_change`, bypassing intended time-based restrictions.
4. Alternatively, attacker calls `merge()` to combine tokens without updating `ownership_change`, potentially manipulating voting power or other token-based mechanics without triggering protection mechanisms.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Update the `split()` and `merge()` functions to include the `ownership_change` update, ensuring that the protection mechanism is consistently applied across all ownership-changing operations:

```diff
function split(uint _tokenId, uint amount) external {
    // ... existing code ...
    _remove_from(_tokenId, amount, unlock_time, _locked);
+   ownership_change[_newTokenId] = block.number; // Update ownership change for new token
    // ... existing code ...
}

function merge(uint _from, uint _to) external {
    // ... existing code ...
    _checkpoint(_from, _locked0, LockedBalance(0, 0));
    _burn(_from);
+   ownership_change[_to] = block.number; // Update ownership change for merged token
    // ... existing code ...
}
```

This change will ensure that all functions that affect token ownership consistently update the `ownership_change` mapping, maintaining the intended security properties of the contract.
