# `ownershipChange` can be by passed to perform flashloan attack

## Summary
In the `VE` contract, whenever a token is transferred using `_transferFrom(...)` the `ownership_change` variable is updated in state to prevent a user from performing flash loan attack by transferring and voting with a token in the same block

## Vulnerability Detail
This is not sufficient because  `ownership_change` is updated exclusively on `_transferFrom(...)`, we can bypass it by 
- splitting the token into a new tokenId which will not have the `ownership_change` effected
- perform the attack with the new token
```solidity
    function _transferFrom(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint _tokenId,
        address _sender // either approved spender, operator or owner
    ) internal {
        ..........
        // Set the block of ownership transfer (for Flash NFT protection)
 >>>    ownership_change[_tokenId] = block.number;

        .....
    }

    function balanceOfNFTAt(uint _tokenId, uint _t) external view returns (uint) {
        return _balanceOfNFT(_tokenId, _t);
    }

    function balanceOfNFT(uint _tokenId) external view returns (uint) {
        if (ownership_change[_tokenId] == block.number) return 0;
        return _balanceOfNFT(_tokenId, block.timestamp);
    }
```
Also, `balanceOfNFTAt(..)` for this token does not have this `ownership_change` check, hence an external protocol that use the `balanceOfNFTAt(...)` function call will be susceptible to flashloan attacks and this can lead to loss of funds

## Impact
This can lead to flash loan attacks which can cause substantial material loss for users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider updating the `ownership_change` in functions that lead to changes in voting power and birth of new tokens
