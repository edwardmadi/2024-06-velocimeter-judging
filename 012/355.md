# Pair is missing unchecked blocks where underflow/overflow is desired, which will brick it over time

## Summary

Due to missing unchecked blocks to ever growing variables, overtime the whole Pair will bricked from any interactions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Pair.sol` contract is a fork of uniswapV2, however V2 was build on version `0.5.16` which is a version that did not have any arithmetic underflow/overflow checks out of the box.

However, the pair contract compiles at version `0.8.13`, which has the underflow/overflow checks.

```solidity
 function _update(
        uint balance0,
        uint balance1,
        uint _reserve0,
        uint _reserve1
    ) internal {
        uint blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
            reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
            reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
        }

        Observation memory _point = lastObservation();
        timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _point.timestamp; // compare the last observation with current timestamp, if greater than 30 minutes, record a new event

        if (timeElapsed > periodSize) {
            observations.push(
                Observation(
                    blockTimestamp,
                    reserve0CumulativeLast,
                    reserve1CumulativeLast
                )
            );
        }
        reserve0 = balance0;
        reserve1 = balance1;
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }
```

As we can see from the snippet of `Pair::_update` the variables `reserve0CumulativeLast` and `reserve1CumulativeLast` are ever growing variables, which means after sometimes they are expected to overflow and start over.

However due to the compiler version of the contract, once they overflow they will always revert bricking any function that calls `_update()`.

The `_update()` function is called internally by `mint()`, `burn()` and `swap()`, if it were to overflow it would DoS all of the entry points in the pair.

## Impact

Complete DoS of any Pair over time.

## Recommendation

Consider adding unchecked block whenever `reserve0Cumulative` and `reserve1Cumulative` are used.:
