# Pair contract could break because of overflow.

## Summary
The _update() function relies on intentional overflow, which causes reversion and breaks core pool functionalities when using Solidity 0.8.0 or above.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Pair` contract, the `_update()` function, which is called internally by `mint()`, `burn()`, and `swap()`, includes the following code:

```solidity
uint256 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
    reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
    reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
}
```

This code is forked from the Uniswap V2 source code and is designed to allow overflow. It functions correctly when using Solidity versions below 0.8.0, but it will revert when using Solidity versions 0.8.0 or above. 

## Impact
If this reversion occurs, it will break all core functionalities of the pool, including `mint()`, `burn()`, and `swap()`.

        blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        ...

        if (_blockTimestampLast != blockTimestamp) {
@>>         // subtraction overflow is desired
            uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _blockTimestampLast;
            reserve0Cumulative += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
            reserve1Cumulative += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
        }
    }

## Recommendation
Use `unchecked {}` around overflow desired areas.
