# The `Pair` contract will revert where overflow is desired, causing loss of funds

## Summary

The `Pair` contract utilizes some functionalities from `Uniswap V2`, one of them being the `_update` function, which is intended to overflow.

However, the `UniswapV2` source code was developed using Solidity version < 0.8.0, where overflow would wrap around instead of reverting. 

Since `Velocimeter V4` utilizes Solidity version >= 0.8.0, `Pair::_update` will permanently DoS, bricking core functionality within the `Pair` contract and locked funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

[Pair.sol#L161-L179](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Pair.sol#L161-L179)
```javascript
    // update reserves and, on the first call per block, price accumulators
    function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) internal {
        uint blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
@>      uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
@>          reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
@>          reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
        }

        Observation memory _point = lastObservation();
        timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _point.timestamp; // compare the last observation with current timestamp, if greater than 30 minutes, record a new event
        if (timeElapsed > periodSize) {
            observations.push(Observation(blockTimestamp, reserve0CumulativeLast, reserve1CumulativeLast));
        }
        reserve0 = balance0;
        reserve1 = balance1;
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }
```

This code is from [Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L73) where overflow is desired. The `dev comments` also confirm overflow is desired.

However, overflow will revert under the current version of solditity used by `Velocimeter`.

## Impact

Permanent DoS for core functions in the `Pair` contract (mint/burn/swap/sync), loss of funds, locked funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Wrap the operation where overflow is intended in an `unchecked` block:

```diff
    // update reserves and, on the first call per block, price accumulators
    function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) internal {
-       uint blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
-       uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
-       if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
-           reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
-           reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
-       }
+       unchecked {
+           uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
+           if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
+               reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
+               reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
+           }
+       }

        Observation memory _point = lastObservation();
        timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _point.timestamp; // compare the last observation with current timestamp, if greater than 30 minutes, record a new event
        if (timeElapsed > periodSize) {
            observations.push(Observation(blockTimestamp, reserve0CumulativeLast, reserve1CumulativeLast));
        }
        reserve0 = balance0;
        reserve1 = balance1;
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }
```
