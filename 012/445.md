# In `Pair.sol`, `currentCumulativePrices()` function will revert when reserveCumulative addition overflow

## Summary
In `Pair.sol`, `currentCumulativePrices()` function will revert when reserveCumulative addition overflow

## Vulnerability Detail
The Solidity version used in `Pair.sol` is `0.8.13`, and there are some breaking changes in Solidity ^v0.8.0:

> Arithmetic operations revert on underflow and overflow.

Solidity Reference: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/080-breaking-changes.html#silent-changes-of-the-semantics

In `Pair.sol`, subtraction overflow is desired at `currentCumulativePrices()` function.

```solidity
    function currentCumulativePrices() public view returns (uint reserve0Cumulative, uint reserve1Cumulative, uint blockTimestamp) {
        blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        reserve0Cumulative = reserve0CumulativeLast;
        reserve1Cumulative = reserve1CumulativeLast;

        // if time has elapsed since the last update on the pair, mock the accumulated price values
        (uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1, uint _blockTimestampLast) = getReserves();
        if (_blockTimestampLast != blockTimestamp) {
@>            // subtraction overflow is desired                 @audit // overflow is desired but can not be achieved
            uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _blockTimestampLast;
            reserve0Cumulative += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
            reserve1Cumulative += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
        }
    }
```
`Pair.currentCumulativePrices()` is inspired/referenced from uniswap's UniswapV2OracleLibrary.sol. Uniswap's currentCumulativePrices() function can be checked [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/libraries/UniswapV2OracleLibrary.sol#L26) where overflow was desired and Uniswap had used solidity compiler version 0.5.0.

The issue is that the `overflow` is desired in `currentCumulativePrices()` function but it can not be achieved in current implementation as the contract uses `0.8.13` compiler version where overflow and underflow is checked by default and it will revert on overflow automatically. In another word, `Pair.sol` will only correctly works at solidity `< 0.8.0`.

As a result, when `reserve0Cumulative` or `reserve1Cumulative` is big enough, `currentCumulativePrices()` will revert due to overflow, however current implementation does not expect the revert but overflow is expected.

## Impact
Since the `overflow` is desired in the original uniswap version, and it's broken because of using Solidity version 0.8.13 in Pair contract. `Pair.currentCumulativePrices()` will break when the desired overflow happens, and further breaks other parts of the system that relies on Pair.sol i.e `current()` function, etc.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `unchecked{}` block to get the desired overflow so that function should not unexpectedly revert.

Consider below changes:

```diff
    function currentCumulativePrices() public view returns (uint reserve0Cumulative, uint reserve1Cumulative, uint blockTimestamp) {
        blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        reserve0Cumulative = reserve0CumulativeLast;
        reserve1Cumulative = reserve1CumulativeLast;

        // if time has elapsed since the last update on the pair, mock the accumulated price values
        (uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1, uint _blockTimestampLast) = getReserves();
-        if (_blockTimestampLast != blockTimestamp) {
-            // subtraction overflow is desired
-            uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _blockTimestampLast;
-            reserve0Cumulative += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
-            reserve1Cumulative += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
-        }
+       unchecked {        
+          if (_blockTimestampLast != blockTimestamp) {
+              // subtraction overflow is desired
+             uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _blockTimestampLast;
+             reserve0Cumulative += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
+             reserve1Cumulative += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
+          }
+      }
    }
