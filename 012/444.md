# `Pair.sol` could break and potential permanent DoS due to overflow

## Summary
`Pair.sol` could break and potential permanent DoS due to overflow

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Pair.sol`, _update() function is implemented as:

```solidity
    function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) internal {
        uint blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
@>        uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired           @audit // check here
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
@>            reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
@>            reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
        }


                . . . some code . . . 
      
      
    }
```

`_update()` is actually referenced/inspired from `Uniswap's UniswapV2Pair.sol` where `_update()` is implemented as below:

```solidity
    function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1) private {
        require(balance0 <= uint112(-1) && balance1 <= uint112(-1), 'UniswapV2: OVERFLOW');
        uint32 blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp % 2**32);
@>        uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired     
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
@>            // * never overflows, and + overflow is desired                
            price0CumulativeLast += uint(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve1).uqdiv(_reserve0)) * timeElapsed;
            price1CumulativeLast += uint(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve0).uqdiv(_reserve1)) * timeElapsed;
        }

       . . . some code
    }
```

At both `@>` marked locations, overflow is intentionally desired in the calculations for `timeElapsed`  and `reserveCumulative`. Therefore, this should also be applicable to Velodrome's `Pair.sol's` `_update()` function as this is missed in `Velocimeter` implementation.

Now, coming back to `Velocimeter's` `Pair.sol`:

`_update()`  is called as an internal function and it is executed in following functions:

1) mint()
2) burn()
3) swap()
4) sync()

This code is actually forked from the `UniswapV2 source code`, and itâ€™s meant and known to overflow. UniswapV2 was developed using Solidity version `0.5.16`, where arithmetic operations overflow and underflow by default.

The reason is because [Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L73) uses an older version of Solidity (0.5.16) where overflow does not revert. This is intentional as stated in the code comments that overflow by addition is desired.

However, for `Velocimeter's` `Pair.sol` this **desired overflow cannot happen** as it uses a newer version of Solidity `0.8.13` where overflows are caught and reverted automatically .

If this happens all the core functionalities of the contract would break, including mint(), burn(), swap() and sync().

## Impact
This issue could potentially lead to permanent denial of service for a pool. All the core functionalities such as `mint()`, `burn()`, `swap()` and `sync()` would be broken. Consequently, all funds would be locked within the contract.

## Recommendation
Wrap the operation around an unchecked{} block.

```diff
    function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) internal {
        uint blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
-        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
-            reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
-            reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
-        }
+       unchecked {
+             if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
+                 reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
+                 reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
+            }
+     }
        Observation memory _point = lastObservation();
        timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _point.timestamp; // compare the last observation with current timestamp, if greater than 30 minutes, record a new event
        if (timeElapsed > periodSize) {
            observations.push(Observation(blockTimestamp, reserve0CumulativeLast, reserve1CumulativeLast));
        }
        reserve0 = balance0;
        reserve1 = balance1;
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }
