# Overflow in `Pair::_update()` will cause DoS for Users

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`Pair`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Pair.sol) contract implements core functionalities for a decentralized exchange, including liquidity provision, token swapping, and price oracle services. The [`_update()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Pair.sol#L162-L179) function is a critical internal method called by various external functions such as `mint()`, `burn()`, and `swap()`. It updates reserve balances, calculates cumulative prices for the price oracle, and manages observations for TWAP calculations.

The [`_update()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Pair.sol#L162-L179) function relies on overflow behavior in its calculations, particularly for time elapsed and cumulative reserve updates. However, the contract is written in Solidity 0.8.13, which introduces automatic overflow checks for arithmetic operations. This mismatch between the intended overflow behavior and the compiler's safeguards leads to a critical vulnerability.

Specifically, in the [`_update()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Pair.sol#L162-L179) function:

```solidity
function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) internal {
    uint blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
@>     uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
    if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
        reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
        reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
    }
    // ... (rest of the function)
}
```

The line `uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast;` is intended to allow overflow, but in Solidity 0.8.13, this will cause a revert due to the automatic overflow check. Similarly, the cumulative reserve calculations can also overflow and cause a revert.

This issue can lead to a permanent DoS for the pool, preventing users from performing essential operations like minting, burning, or swapping tokens, thereby locking all funds within the contract.

## Impact
The vulnerability renders the core functionalities of the DEX inoperable, effectively freezing all user funds within the affected pair contracts. Users will be unable to add or remove liquidity, perform swaps, or interact with the contract in any meaningful way. This complete loss of functionality represents a critical failure of the system, potentially leading to significant financial losses for users and a loss of trust in the protocol.

## Proof of Concept
1. User A adds liquidity to a pair contract, calling the `mint()` function.
2. Time passes, and the `blockTimestamp` becomes greater than `blockTimestampLast`.
3. User B attempts to swap tokens, which internally calls `_update()`.
4. The `timeElapsed` calculation in `_update()` causes an overflow.
5. The transaction reverts due to Solidity 0.8.13's overflow protection.
6. All subsequent calls to `mint()`, `burn()`, or `swap()` will fail, as they all call `_update()`.
7. The pair contract becomes permanently unusable, and all funds are locked.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, the `unchecked` way should be used to maintain the desired overflow behavior in Solidity 0.8.X +. Here's the recommended change:

```diff
function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) internal {
    uint blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
+    unchecked {
        uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
            reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
            reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
+        }
    }
    // ... (rest of the function)
}
```
