# `Pair` contract incorrectly assumes the underlying tokens are not misbehaving leading to potential to break core AMM invariant

## Summary
`Pair::swap` does not follow the CEI pattern and performs its key invariant check `(balance0 * balance1) >= (reserves0 * reserves1)` before then making an external call that could change the value of `balance0` and `balance1` to something that would break the invariant.

## Vulnerability Detail
The core invariant of AMM protocols is that the product of balances must be greater than or equal to the product of the reserves (overall liquidity remains the same or deepens after a swap). However `Pair::swap` checks for this core invariant before then updating `_balance0` and `_balance1` to new values as shown here:
```solidity
        if (amount0In != 0) _balance0 = _balance0 - fee0;
        if (amount1In != 0) _balance1 = _balance1 - fee1;

        require(_k(_balance0, _balance1) >= _k(_reserve0, _reserve1), 'K'); // Pair: K
        }
        
        _balance0 = IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this)); 
        _balance1 = IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this));
```

There is no check that the invariant holds with these new values. Additionally, between setting the original values for `_balance0` and `_balance1` there is an external state changing call made to the potentially misbehaving token contract during `ExternalBribe::notifyRewardAmount` (called via `_sendTokenFees`) in which this misbehaviour could take place. 

Given that this version of the protocol plans to allow for semi permissionless creation of pairs/gauges it is important the contract does not make assumptions that the tokens involved in these pairs will behave as expected.

## Impact
A misbehaving token could break the `balances >= reserves` core invariant of AMMs. This would allow a malicious token to manipulate it's price by artificially lowering it's balance in the pool while bypassing the invariant check.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The invariant check that the product of current balances should be greater than the product of the reserves should be made after making the external call that updates `_balance0` and `_balance1`. This way even if the token has unexpected behaviour the invariant will have to hold based on the contract's final state.

As shown here, the original Velodrome V1 `Pair` contract correctly makes the invariant check after proceeding with the final updates for balances. [here](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/v1/blob/master/contracts/Pair.sol#L365)
