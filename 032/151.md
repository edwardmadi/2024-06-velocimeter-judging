# Revert on large approvals

## Summary
Some tokens do not support large approve amounts, which will result in failures

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Pair.setExternalBribe()` function, the protocol approves the maximum allowance for `externalBribe`, which is `type(uint).max`. Some tokens, such as UNI and COMP, have a maximum allowed limit of uint96, so a large approve will fail.
```solidity
    function setExternalBribe(address _externalBribe) external {
        require(msg.sender == voter, 'Only voter can set external bribe');
        externalBribe = _externalBribe;
        _safeApprove(token0, externalBribe, type(uint).max);
        _safeApprove(token1, externalBribe, type(uint).max);
        emit ExternalBribeSet(_externalBribe);
    }
```

## Impact
The protocol cannot perform approve
