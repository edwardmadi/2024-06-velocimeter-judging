# Lack of Zero Address Check

## Summary
The `totalSupply` of  token minted to zero address would increase by the minted amount.
## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Flow.sol#L80

The ```_mint```   function increases `totalSupply` regardless of the recipient, there's no check that prevent minting tokens to the zero address ```(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000```  which leads to a situation where `totalSupply` may increase even if tokens are minted to zero address  without the tokens being accessible to anyone.

Consider a scenario where minter could call `mint` function withe zero address the `totalSupply` may increases by `1000000000000000` while the  `balanceOf[_to] += _value;` may increases to 1000000000000000. and the  token will be locked forever.
     
```solidity
mint(address(0), 1000000000000000);
```

## Impact
Loss of user funds as the `totalSupply` will include the  minted tokens of the zero address, leading to an inflated total supply.
## Code Snippet

Mint function 

```solidity
    function _mint(address _to, uint _amount) internal returns (bool) {
        totalSupply += _amount;
        unchecked {
            balanceOf[_to] += _amount;
        }
        emit Transfer(address(0x0), _to, _amount);
        return true;
    }
 ```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 implement a zero address  check, to ensure that the `totalSupply`  reflects the circulating supply.
