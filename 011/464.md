# Malicious user could flash-loan their token to inflate the voting balance of their account

## Summary
The `VotingEscrow::balanceOfNFT(...)` function first checks if ownership change of the _tokenId is in the current block, if it is then return zero. This is done to ensure a newly transferred NFT tokens to have zero voting balance to prevent someone from flash-loaning NFT tokens to inflate their voting balance. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The check is done with the `ownership_change` which is updated only when a token is transferred from one user to another.
However, this check is missing from the `balanceOfNFTAt(..)` and `_balanceOfNFT(...)` functions respectively

```solidity
    function balanceOfNFT(uint _tokenId) external view returns (uint) {
->      if (ownership_change[_tokenId] == block.number) return 0;
        return _balanceOfNFT(_tokenId, block.timestamp);
    }

    function balanceOfNFTAt(uint _tokenId, uint _t) external view returns (uint) {
        return _balanceOfNFT(_tokenId, _t);
    }

    function _transferFrom(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint _tokenId,
        address _sender
    ) internal {
        ....
        // Set the block of ownership transfer (for Flash NFT protection)
 ->     ownership_change[_tokenId] = block.number;
        .....
    }
```

As a result, VM or some external protocol trying to use `balanceOfNFTAt` and `balanceOfNFT` external functions to find voting balance will return different voting balances for the same `tokenId` depending on which function they called.

Within the VM protocol's voting escrow contract, the `tokenURI(...)`, `getVotes(...)` and `getPastVotes(...)` functions use the `_balanceOfNFT(...)` function too to calculate voting power.

In the case of `tokenURI()` a flash loan can be used to change the token URI for any token

## Impact
Users can inflate their voting power with a flashloan attack which they can use to perform exploits in the VM protocol or other external protocols that integrate with VM

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the `ownership_change` check to the `balanceOfNFTAt(..)` and `balanceOfNFT(...)` functions respectively
