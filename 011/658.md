# `balanceOfNFTAt()` in `VotingEscrow.sol` does not implement flashloan protection similar to `balanceOfNFT()` function

## Summary
`balanceOfNFTAt()` in `VotingEscrow.sol` does not implement flashloan protection similar to `balanceOfNFT()` function

## Vulnerability Detail
_This issue is actually referenced from spearbit's Velodrome audit which can be checked [here](https://solodit.xyz/issues/inconsistent-between-balanceofnft-balanceofnftat-and_balanceofnft-functions-spearbit-none-velodrome-finance-pdf)_

The `balanceOfNFT()` function implements a flash-loan protection that returns zero voting balance if `ownership_change[_tokenId] == block.number`. 

```solidity
    function balanceOfNFT(uint _tokenId) external view returns (uint) {
@>        if (ownership_change[_tokenId] == block.number) return 0;
        return _balanceOfNFT(_tokenId, block.timestamp);
    }
```
However, this was not consistently applied to the `balanceOfNFTAt()`and `_balanceOfNFT()` functions. 

```solidity
    function balanceOfNFTAt(uint _tokenId, uint _t) external view returns (uint) {
        return _balanceOfNFT(_tokenId, _t);         @audit // missing flashloan protection
    }
```

As a result, Velocimeter or external protocols calling the `balanceOfNFT()` and `balanceOfNFTAt()` external functions will receive different voting balances for the same veNFT depending on which function they called.

Additionally, the internal `_balanceOfNFT()` function, which does not have flash-loan protection and its used in following functions:

1) `tokenURI()`
2) `getVotes()`
3) `getPastVotes()`

The vote function getters computes the voting balance of an account and can be used to inflate the voting balance.

If the requirement is to have all newly transferred veNFTs (ownership_change[_tokenId] == block.number) have zero voting balance to prevent someone from flash-loaning veNFT to increase their voting balance, the flash-loan protection should be consistently implemented across all the related functions.

## Impact
Malicious user could flash-loan the veNFTs to inflate the voting balance of their account, since users are able to inflate their voting power, which they can use to vote for a malicious proposal

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Flashloan protection check should be implemented in `balanceOfNFTAt()` and `_balanceOfNFT()` functions and to be inconsistent with flashloan prevented `balanceOfNFT()` function.
