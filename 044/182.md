# The implementation of `swapOutRewardToken()` in `GaugeV4.sol` is incorrect

## Summary
The implementation of `swapOutRewardToken()` in `GaugeV4.sol` is incorrect, causing `rewardToken` to bypass the `isWhitelisted` check.

## Vulnerability Detail
ReadMe of sherlock is as following.
    >Tokens that are used for rewards/bribes that are not part of the pool needs to be whitelisted by protocol.

Next, let's look at `swapOutRewardToken()` in `GaugeV4.sol`.
```solidity
    function swapOutRewardToken(uint i, address oldToken, address newToken) external {
        require(msg.sender == IVotingEscrow(_ve).team(), 'only team');
        require(rewards[i] == oldToken);
        isReward[oldToken] = false;
        isReward[newToken] = true;
        rewards[i] = newToken;
    }
```
As you can see, there is no check of whitelist about `newToken` in `swapOutRewardToken()`.
Since the `swapOutRewardToken()` function does not check whether `newToken` is whitelisted, weird tokens may be added to the `rewards` list, which may have a negative impact on the protocol as a result.

## Impact
Weird tokens may be added to the `rewards` list, which may eventually have a negative impact on the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `swapOutRewardToken()` in `GaugeV4.sol` is modified as follows.
```solidity
    function swapOutRewardToken(uint i, address oldToken, address newToken) external {
        require(msg.sender == IVotingEscrow(_ve).team(), 'only team');
        require(rewards[i] == oldToken);
+++     require(IVoter(voter).isWhitelisted(newToken), "rewards tokens must be whitelisted");
        isReward[oldToken] = false;
        isReward[newToken] = true;
        rewards[i] = newToken;
    }
```
