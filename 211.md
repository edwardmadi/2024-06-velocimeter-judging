# Significant precision loss when calculating gauge's reward rate.

## Summary
Significant precision loss when calculating gauge's reward rate.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calculating the gauge's reward rate, scaling is not used. Instead, the amount that is distributed is simply divided by `DURATION` in order to calculate the reward rate per second. 

```solidity
            amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
            rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / DURATION;
```

This would cause rounding down of up to `DURATION` (604800). If the reward token for example is WBTC, this rounding down will equal to `604800 * 60_000 / 1e8 = $362` (considering btc price of $60k)
