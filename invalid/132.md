# Attacker can bypass contract checks by exploiting `VotingEscrow::_isContract()` vulnerability

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `VotingEscrow` contract implements a crucial security mechanism through its [`_isContract()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L380-L389), which is designed to differentiate between contract addresses and externally owned accounts (EOAs). This function is integral to the contract's security model, potentially being used in various access control and validation checks throughout the system.

The `_isContract()` function relies on the `extcodesize` opcode to determine if an address belongs to a contract:

```solidity
function _isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool) {
    uint size;
    assembly {
        size := extcodesize(account)
    }
    return size > 0;
}
```

However, this implementation has a critical flaw. An attacker can exploit this by deploying a contract, interacting with the system, self-destructing the contract, and then recreating it at the same address using the `CREATE2` opcode. This method allows the attacker to bypass the `_isContract()` check, as a self-destructed contract will appear as an EOA to this function.

The vulnerability stems from the fact that `extcodesize` returns 0 for self-destructed contracts and contracts during construction. By leveraging `CREATE2` and `selfdestruct`, an attacker can manipulate the contract's state to appear as an EOA at will, potentially circumventing critical security checks within the `VotingEscrow` system.

## Impact

The ability to bypass the `_isContract()` check could severely compromise the security model of the `VotingEscrow` contract. Attackers could potentially:

1. Gain unauthorized access to functions intended only for EOAs.
2. Manipulate voting power or token balances in ways not intended by the protocol.
3. Evade blacklisting or other security measures that rely on accurately identifying contract addresses.

This vulnerability undermines the core security assumptions of the contract, potentially leading to financial losses, manipulation of governance processes, or other malicious activities depending on how `_isContract()` is utilized throughout the system.


## Proof of Concept

1. Attacker deploys a malicious contract:
   ```solidity
   contract MaliciousContract {
       function attack() external {
           // Perform malicious action
       }
       
       function disappear() external {
           selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender));
       }
   }
   ```

2. Attacker interacts with `VotingEscrow`, exploiting vulnerabilities that rely on `_isContract()`.
3. Attacker calls `disappear()`, self-destructing the contract.
4. Attacker redeploys the contract at the same address using `CREATE2`:
   ```solidity
   contract AttackerFactory {
       function redeployMalicious(bytes32 salt) external returns (address) {
           return address(new MaliciousContract{salt: salt}());
       }
   }
   ```

5. The redeployed contract now appears as an EOA to `_isContract()`, bypassing security checks.
6. Attacker can repeat steps 2-5 to continually evade detection and exploit the system.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, implement a more robust mechanism for identifying and managing addresses. Consider the following approach:

1. Implement a persistent blacklist for known malicious addresses.
2. Use a combination of checks, including transaction history and balance, to determine if an address is likely a contract.
3. Implement a time-lock or cool-down period for certain critical operations.
