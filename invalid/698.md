# Unsafe Use of 'transfer()'/'transferFrom()' on ERC20

## Summary
Using the _'transfer()'_ and _'transferFrom()'_ functions directly on the ERC20 contract within the _'VotingEscrow.sol'_ contract causes incompatibility with certain tokens that do not properly follow the ERC20 standard, such as Tether (USDT). This may result in unanticipated transaction failures and potential loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Tokens such as Tether (USDT) do not return boolean values ​​as per ERC20 standard specifications in the _'transfer()'_ and _'transferFrom()'_ functions. Instead, these functions do not return any values, which causes a function signature mismatch when the token is cast to the _'IERC20'_ interface. This can result in the function call being made failing and the transaction being aborted.

## Impact
- may cause transactions to fail on tokens that do not properly follow ERC20 standards
- resulting in operational failure of the contract
- decreased user trust
- potential loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the _'safeTransfer()'_ and _'safeTransferFrom()'_ functions from OpenZeppelin's _'SafeERC20'_ library to ensure compatibility with all tokens that claim to conform to the ERC20 standard, including those that do not properly follow the specification.
