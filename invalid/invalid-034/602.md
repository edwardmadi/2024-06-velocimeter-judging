# Pair.sol cannot deploy pools with non-string symbol() ERC20s

## Summary
In the Pair.sol contract in constructor, requires fetching the `symbol()` for token0 and token1. However, it assumes that symbol() returns a string, which is actually OPTIONAL according to ERC20 standards. As a result, the contract will fail to create pools for ERC20 tokens that do not implement symbol().

## Vulnerability Detail
First, let's quote the [EIP20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) to show symbol() is optional:
```code
symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. “HIX”.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

function symbol() public view returns (string)
```

The contest README states:
```code
Users can create the liquidity pools for any of the ERC20 tokens in permissionless way.
```

## Impact
Pair contract cannot be created for ERC20s that does not implement function symbol() public view returns (string).

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make a low-level call to retrieve the symbol and then convert the result to a string.
