# Pair contract cannot work with Tokens which symbol returns bytes32 value.

## Summary
There are some tokens whose symbol's unit is `bytes32`. When we want to create one pair with this kind of token, the creation will be reverted.

## Vulnerability Detail
From the readme, the sponsor mentioned that `Users can create the liquidity pools for any of the ERC20 tokens in permissionless way. Our internal router is not supporting fee on transfer tokens. Swap on that type of tokens needs to be done by external aggregators.`
Based on above assumption, users can create pools with any of the ERC20 tokens except transfer-on-fee tokens.
When we try to create one pair, pair contract will construct one name/symbol for the pool LP token based on liquidity tokens' symbols.
When we try to get the tokens' symbol, we use the `IERC20` interface, expect one string as the return value. However, there're some wired tokens which they will not return `string` but `bytes32`, for example, MKR. This will cause the `IERC20(token).symbol()` will be reverted. And we cannot create one pair based on this kind of tokens.

```javascript
    constructor() {
        factory = msg.sender;
        setVoter();
        (address _token0, address _token1, bool _stable) = IPairFactory(msg.sender).getInitializable();
        (token0, token1, stable) = (_token0, _token1, _stable);
        if (_stable) {
            name = string(abi.encodePacked("StableV1 AMM - ", IERC20(_token0).symbol(), "/", IERC20(_token1).symbol()));
            symbol = string(abi.encodePacked("sAMM-", IERC20(_token0).symbol(), "/", IERC20(_token1).symbol()));
        } else {
            name = string(abi.encodePacked("VolatileV1 AMM - ", IERC20(_token0).symbol(), "/", IERC20(_token1).symbol()));
            symbol = string(abi.encodePacked("vAMM-", IERC20(_token0).symbol(), "/", IERC20(_token1).symbol()));
        }
    ......
}
``` 
```javascript
interface IERC20 {
    ...
    function symbol() external view returns (string memory);
    ...
}
```

## Impact
LP pools with some special tokens cannot be created successfully.

## Recommendation
Considering using name() or try low-level call to get symbol() returning value and convert it to string if needed.
