# Missing Access Control in `createGauge` Function

krkbaa
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
in GaugeFactoryV4.sol contract the `createGauge` function lacks proper access control mechanisms, and does not validate the input parameters, allowing any external account to call it and create new GaugeV4 instances. This omission poses a security risk as unauthorized users could potentially abuse the system by creating unnecessary gauges or consuming excessive resources.
