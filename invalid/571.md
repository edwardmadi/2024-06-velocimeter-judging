# RewardsDistributorV2.tokensPerWeek might be zero in some extreme cases

## Summary
`RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week` is used to record the amount of token to distribute per week, if its value is zero, it means there is no token to be distributed. In current implementation, there will be an extreme case when the `RewardsDistributorV2._checkpoint_token` isn't called for more than 20 weeks, some weeks in the past will have empty `RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [RewardsDistributorV2._checkpoint_token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L64-L95), the function will update `last_token_time` to `block.timestamp` first, and then loop 20 WEEK in for-loop
```solidity
64     function _checkpoint_token() internal {
...
69        uint t = lastTokenTime;
70        uint since_last = block.timestamp - t;
71         last_token_time = block.timestamp; <<<--- lastTokenTime is updated to block.timestamp
72        uint this_week = t / WEEK * WEEK;
73        uint next_week = 0;
74 
75         for (uint256 i = 0; i < 20; i++) { <<<--- here 20 is used, it means that the function will loop 20 weeks at most
...
```
__And next time when `RewardsDistributorV2._checkpoint_token` is called, the function record `RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week` from the timestamp the function is called instead of the `RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week` hasn't been recorded.__
So if the `RewardsDistributorV2._checkpoint_token` hasn't been called in more than 20 weeks, the `RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week` will be like:
RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week[week_00] -> value_00
RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week[week_01] -> value_01
RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week[week_02] -> value_02
...
RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week[week_19] -> value_19
RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week[week_20] -> 0
RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week[week_21] -> 0
RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week[week_22] -> 0
...
RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week[week_nn] -> value_nn   <<<<--- next RewardsDistributorV2._checkpoint_token is called, the `RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week` will be updated from here
RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week[week_nm] -> value_nm

## Impact
Because `RewardsDistributorV2.tokens_per_week` is used to calculate the amount of token a user can claim, if its value is 0, it means there will be no token to be claimed.
