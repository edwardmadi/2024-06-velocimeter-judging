# Unauthorized Users Can Manipulate Voting Power of Locked and Managed NFTs in `VotingEscrow::deposit_for()`

## Summary

The `VotingEscrow` contract allows users to lock tokens to receive voting power represented by NFTs. These NFTs come in different types: normal, locked, and managed, each with distinct properties and intended usage within the protocol's governance system.

The `deposit_for()` function is designed to allow additional token deposits for existing NFTs, increasing their locked amount and consequently their voting power. However, this function lacks crucial access controls and type checks, leading to a severe vulnerability in the voting system.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementation of `deposit_for()` only verifies basic conditions:

```solidity
function deposit_for(uint _tokenId, uint _value) external nonreentrant {
    LockedBalance memory _locked = locked[_tokenId];

    require(_value > 0); // dev: need non-zero value
    require(_locked.amount > 0, 'No existing lock found');
    require(_locked.end > block.timestamp, 'Cannot add to expired lock. Withdraw');
    _deposit_for(_tokenId, _value, 0, _locked, DepositType.DEPOSIT_FOR_TYPE);
}
```

The issue lies in the absence of checks for the NFT type and the caller's permissions. This oversight allows any user to call `deposit_for()` on any NFT, including locked and managed types, which should have restricted access due to their special roles in the governance system.

This opens the door for malicious actors to manipulate voting power by depositing additional tokens into locked or managed NFTs, potentially disrupting the intended balance of the voting system and leading to unfair distribution of governance influence within the protocol.

## Impact

The unrestricted access to `deposit_for()` severely compromises the integrity of the voting system implemented by the VotingEscrow contract. Malicious users can artificially inflate the voting power of locked and managed NFTs, leading to an unfair distribution of governance influence and potential manipulation of protocol decisions.

This vulnerability undermines the core functionality of the `VotingEscrow` contract and could result in a loss of trust in the protocol's governance mechanisms. If locked NFTs are not supposed to participate in voting, increasing their balance could lead to unexpected behavior in other parts of the system that rely on these assumptions. For `managed NFTs`, unauthorized deposits could interfere with the intended management strategies, potentially causing financial losses or further system imbalances.

## Proof of Concept

1. Alice creates a locked NFT (ID: 1) by calling `create_lock()` with 1000 tokens for 52 weeks.
2. Bob, an attacker who doesn't own NFT 1, calls `deposit_for(1, 500)`.
3. The `deposit_for()` function executes successfully, increasing the locked amount of NFT 1 to 1500 tokens.
4. Alice's voting power for NFT 1 is now 50% higher than intended, without her action or consent.
5. If NFT 1 was a locked NFT not meant for voting, it now incorrectly has voting power, potentially skewing governance decisions.
6. Bob repeats this process for multiple locked and managed NFTs, significantly distorting the voting power distribution in the protocol.

## Recommendation

To address this issue, implement proper access controls and type checks in the `deposit_for()` function. Here's the suggested fix:

```diff
// ... existing code ...
function deposit_for(uint _tokenId, uint _value) external nonreentrant {
+    require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId), "Not authorized");
      LockedBalance memory _locked = locked[_tokenId];

    require(_value > 0); // dev: need non-zero value
    require(_locked.amount > 0, 'No existing lock found');
    require(_locked.end > block.timestamp, 'Cannot add to expired lock. Withdraw');
    _deposit_for(_tokenId, _value, 0, _locked, DepositType.DEPOSIT_FOR_TYPE);
}
// ... existing code ...
```

This change ensures that only the NFT owner or an approved operator can deposit additional tokens, maintaining the integrity of the voting system.
