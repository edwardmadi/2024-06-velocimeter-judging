# Tokens are allowed to be deposited for locked NFTs for that epoch causing lesser rewards yield

## Summary
Users can create a lock to vote for token emission in pools. However, anyone can deposit tokens for any tokens including  against a locked NFT.

## Vulnerability Detail
Locked veNFTs are NFTs voted for pools in return for more rewards. Users should not be allowed to increase the voting power of a locked NFT by calling the `deposit_for` or `increase_amount` function because locked NFTs are not meant to be re-voted in the same epoch.  Consequently, this causes any increase in the voting balance of locked NFTs will not enhance the gauge weight, thus diminishing the influence and yield of the deposited FLOW. 

```solidity
//VotingEscrow.sol
    /// @notice Deposit `_value` tokens for `_tokenId` and add to the lock
    /// @dev Anyone (even a smart contract) can deposit for someone else, but
    ///      cannot extend thlock timetime and deposit brand-new new user
    /// @param _tokenId lock NFT
    /// @param _value Amount to add to user's lock
    function deposit_for(uint _tokenId, uint _value) external nonreentrant {
        LockedBalance memory _locked = locked[_tokenId];

        require(_value > 0); // dev: need non-zero value
        require(_locked.amount > 0, 'No existing lock found');
        require(_locked.end > block.timestamp, 'Cannot add to expired lock. Withdraw');
        _deposit_for(_tokenId, _value, 0, _locked, DepositType.DEPOSIT_FOR_TYPE);
    }

    function increase_amount(uint _tokenId, uint _value) external nonreentrant {
        assert(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));

        LockedBalance memory _locked = locked[_tokenId];

        assert(_value > 0); // dev: need non-zero value
        require(_locked.amount > 0, 'No existing lock found');
        require(_locked.end > block.timestamp, 'Cannot add to expired lock. Withdraw');

        _deposit_for(_tokenId, _value, 0, _locked, DepositType.INCREASE_LOCK_AMOUNT);
    }


    function voting(uint _tokenId) external {
        require(msg.sender == voter);
        voted[_tokenId] = true;
    }
```
When the user votes, the veNFTs are locked by `Voter.sol` calling `VotingEscrow.sol::voting`. Any increase in the amount will not increase the voting power in that epoch.
```solidity
//Voter.sol
    function _vote(uint _tokenId, address[] memory _poolVote, uint256[] memory _weights) internal {
        if (_usedWeight > 0) IVotingEscrow(_ve).voting(_tokenId); 
```

It wasn't stated in README.md as acceptable risk, hence the submission.
## Impact
Loss of rewards yield.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate if tokens are locked before allowing deposits to be called.
