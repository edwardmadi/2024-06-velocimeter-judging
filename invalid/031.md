# Lack of Functionality in Gauge Control Functions

krkbaa
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
in GaugePlugin.sol contract the functions `checkGaugePauseAllowance`, `checkGaugeRestartAllowance`, and `checkGaugeKillAllowance` are designed to return boolean values indicating whether a specific action (pause, restart, or kill) is allowed for a given caller and gauge. However, all these functions consistently return false regardless of input parameters.

## Impact
anything relying on these functions to determine operational permissions may be misled, as all queries will result in denial (false).
