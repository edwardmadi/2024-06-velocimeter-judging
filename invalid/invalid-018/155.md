# The `voter.detachTokenFromGauge()` function lacks access control

## Summary
The `voter.detachTokenFromGauge()` function lacks access control, allowing anyone to call it and perform operations within the VotingEscrow contract. Malicious users can also remove the attachment of any tokenId.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the VotingEscrow contract, many operations such as `merge()`, `split()`, and `withdraw()` require that `attachments[_tokenId] == 0`. However, `voter.detachTokenFromGauge()` lacks any permission control, allowing anyone to call it. This oversight enables individuals to remove attachments, bypassing the checks imposed by `merge()`, `split()`, and `withdraw()`.Malicious users can also remove the attachment of any tokenId.

```solidity
   function detach(uint _tokenId) external {
        require(msg.sender == voter);
        attachments[_tokenId] = attachments[_tokenId] - 1;
    }

```

## Impact
After users deposit through `Gauge.deposit()` in the VotingEscrow contract, they can subsequently call `detachTokenFromGauge()` to remove attachments. This action enables them to then perform operations such as `merge()`, `split()`, and `withdraw()`.

## Recommendation
