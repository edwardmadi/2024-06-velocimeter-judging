# Change to `detachTokenFromGauge` will cause users to have funds stuck

## Summary

Permissioneless voter `detatch` allows anyone to prevent withdrawals from gauges with attachments

## Vulnerability Detail

Velocimeter introduced a way to `killGaugeTotally` which will delete the gayge and allow deploying a new one

To prevent a permanent loss, `detachTokenFromGauge` was changed to not check who the caller was as to allow a totally killed gauge to allow withdrawals

This has the side effect that anyone can now detach people deposited NFTs

This will make it so that users will have some of their funds permanently locked as they won't be able to `detach` all of their Gauges

###

Detach spam to lock users into gauges

## Impact

Users will be unable to withdraw from all the gauges in which they deposited

## Code Snippet

- Victim will have a VE nft and some LP position
- Deposit into gauge with attachment
- Attacker calls `detachTokenFromGauge`
- The attachments count for Victim is 0
- Victim tries to withdraw, the withdrawal fails due to underflow when `detachTokenFromGauge` is called again

```solidity
    function detachTokenFromGauge(uint tokenId, address account) external {
        if (tokenId > 0) IVotingEscrow(_ve).detach(tokenId);
        emit Detach(account, msg.sender, tokenId);
    }
```

Change to check that it's either a valid gauge or the owner/operator of the tokenId
