# Attacker can lock user's funds in Gauge

## Summary
An attacker is able to lock user funds in the Gauge by detaching their veNFT.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the user deposits into a gauge it attaches their veNFT to that gauge:

When the user withdraws their tokens, the veNFT is detached from the gauge:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/GaugeV4.sol#L536-L542

It's possible for anybody to call the `Voter.detachTokenFromGauge()` function directly:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L444-L447

The implementation for VotingEscrow's `attach()` and `detach()` is:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1185-L1193


That enables the following attack vector:

1. Alice deposits X amount of tokens into Gauge Y.
2. `attachments` for Alice's veNFT is 1
3. Attacker calls `Voter.detachTokenFromGauge()` with Alice's veNFT id.
4. `attachments` is now 0
5. Alice calls `Gauge.withdrawToken()` to withdraw her funds. The function calls `detachTokenFromGauge()` which will call `detach()` which will underflow ($0 - 1 = -1$)

To be able to withdraw her funds, Alice has to deposit into another gauge to increase her token's attachments. The attacker can backrun those calls to detach Alice's veNFT again effectively locking up her funds.

## Impact
An attacker can lock user funds temporarily.

## Code Snippet
See above.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only allow a gauge to call `Voter.detachTokenFromGauge()`:

```sol
    function detachTokenFromGauge(uint tokenId, address account) external {
        require(isGauge[msg.sender]);
        if (tokenId > 0) IVotingEscrow(_ve).detach(tokenId);
        emit Detach(account, msg.sender, tokenId);
    }
```
