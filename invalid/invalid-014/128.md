# Malicious user can inflate voting balance via flash-loan in `VotingEscrow::balanceOfNFTAt` and `VotingEscrow::_balanceOfNFT`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `VotingEscrow` contract implements a voting system where users can lock their tokens in exchange for voting power. The voting power is represented by `veNFTs`, which decay over time. The contract includes several functions to check the balance (voting power) of these veNFTs:

1. [`balanceOfNFT()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1031-L1034): Returns the current balance of a veNFT.
2. [`balanceOfNFTAt()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1036-L1038): Returns the balance of a veNFT at a specific timestamp.
3. [`_balanceOfNFT()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1017-L1029): An internal function used by both of the above functions to calculate the balance.

The `balanceOfNFT()` function includes a protection mechanism against flash loans:

```solidity
function balanceOfNFT(uint _tokenId) external view returns (uint) {
    if (ownership_change[_tokenId] == block.number) return 0;
    return _balanceOfNFT(_tokenId, block.timestamp);
}
```

This check prevents the inflation of voting power within the same block by returning zero if the NFT ownership changed in the current block.

However, this protection is missing in both `balanceOfNFTAt()` and `_balanceOfNFT()`:

```solidity
function balanceOfNFTAt(uint _tokenId, uint _t) external view returns (uint) {
    return _balanceOfNFT(_tokenId, _t);
}

function _balanceOfNFT(uint _tokenId, uint _t) internal view returns (uint) {
    uint _epoch = user_point_epoch[_tokenId];
    if (_epoch == 0) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        Point memory last_point = user_point_history[_tokenId][_epoch];
        last_point.bias -= last_point.slope * int128(int256(_t) - int256(last_point.ts));
        if (last_point.bias < 0) {
            last_point.bias = 0;
        }
        return uint(int256(last_point.bias));
    }
}
```

This inconsistency creates a vulnerability where a malicious user can transfer veNFTs within the same block and call `balanceOfNFTAt()` or any function that uses `_balanceOfNFT()` to inflate their voting balance, bypassing the protection implemented in `balanceOfNFT()`.

## Impact
The vulnerability allows malicious users to artificially inflate their voting power within a single block. This can lead to manipulation of governance decisions, unauthorized control over protocol parameters, or unfair allocation of funds. The integrity of the entire voting system is compromised, as users can gain disproportionate influence over protocol decisions without actually holding the corresponding long-term stake in the system.

## Proof of Concept
1. Attacker identifies a large veNFT holder (Alice) willing to participate in the exploit.
2. Attacker sets up a contract to execute the following steps in a single transaction:
   a. Borrow a large amount of tokens from a flash loan provider.
   b. Create a veNFT lock with the borrowed tokens.
   c. Transfer the newly created veNFT to Alice.
   d. Alice calls `balanceOfNFTAt()` or a function using `_balanceOfNFT()` to record an inflated balance.
   e. Alice transfers the veNFT back to the attacker.
   f. Attacker repays the flash loan.
3. The transaction completes within a single block, bypassing the flash loan protection in `balanceOfNFT()`.
4. Alice now has an artificially inflated voting power that can be used in governance decisions.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, add the flash loan protection check to both `balanceOfNFTAt()` and `_balanceOfNFT()` functions. This ensures consistent behavior across all balance-checking functions. Here's the recommended change for `_balanceOfNFT()`:

```diff
function _balanceOfNFT(uint _tokenId, uint _t) internal view returns (uint) {
+   if (ownership_change[_tokenId] == block.number) return 0;
    uint _epoch = user_point_epoch[_tokenId];
    if (_epoch == 0) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        Point memory last_point = user_point_history[_tokenId][_epoch];
        last_point.bias -= last_point.slope * int128(int256(_t) - int256(last_point.ts));
        if (last_point.bias < 0) {
            last_point.bias = 0;
        }
        return uint(int256(last_point.bias));
    }
}
```

By implementing this change, the flash loan protection will be applied consistently across all balance-checking functions, preventing the artificial inflation of voting power within a single block.
