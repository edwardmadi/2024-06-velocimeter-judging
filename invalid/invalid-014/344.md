# Inconsistent Flash Loan Protection Across Balance Functions

## Summary
The VotingEscrow contract implements flash loan protection in the balanceOfNFT function, but this protection is not consistently applied across all balance-related functions, potentially leading to inconsistent voting power calculations and vulnerability to flash loan attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
The balanceOfNFT function includes a check to prevent flash loan attacks:
```solidity
function balanceOfNFT(uint _tokenId) external view returns (uint) {
    if (ownership_change[_tokenId] == block.number) return 0;
    return _balanceOfNFT(_tokenId, block.timestamp);
}
```
However, this protection is not implemented in other related functions such as balanceOfNFTAt and the internal _balanceOfNFT:

## Impact
* Inconsistent voting power calculations: Different functions may return different voting balances for the same veNFT, depending on which function is called.
* Potential for flash loan attacks: Functions without protection could be exploited to temporarily inflate voting power.
* Confusion for external protocols: Protocols integrating with this contract may receive inconsistent results, leading to potential misuse or vulnerabilities in those systems.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function balanceOfNFTAt(uint _tokenId, uint _t) external view returns (uint) {
    return _balanceOfNFT(_tokenId, _t);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
* Implement consistent flash loan protection across all balance-related functions:
```solidity
function balanceOfNFTAt(uint _tokenId, uint _t) external view returns (uint) {
    if (ownership_change[_tokenId] == block.number) return 0;
    return _balanceOfNFT(_tokenId, _t);
}

function _balanceOfNFT(uint _tokenId, uint _t) internal view returns (uint) {
    if (ownership_change[_tokenId] == block.number) return 0;
    // ... (rest of the implementation)
}
```
* Consider moving the flash loan protection check to the internal _balanceOfNFT function to ensure it's applied consistently across all calls.
* Review and update any external functions or protocols that rely on these balance calculations to ensure they handle the flash loan protection consistently.
* If the contract is planning to transition to timestamp-based calculations (as mentioned in the Velodrome response), ensure that a similar protection mechanism is implemented consistently using timestamps instead of block numbers.
