# Flashloan protection inconsistently applied in `balanceOfNFT`. `balanceOfNFTAt` and `_balanceOfNFT` functions

## Summary
Flashloan protection inconsistently applied in `balanceOfNFT`. `balanceOfNFTAt` and `_balanceOfNFT` functions

## Vulnerability Detail
While the `balanceOfNFT` function implements a flashloan protection that returns zero voting balance if `ownership_change[_tokenId] == block.number`, this was not consistently applied in the `balanceOfNFTAt` and `_balanceOfNFT` functions. 

```javascript
VotingEscrow.sol

 function balanceOfNFT(uint _tokenId) external view returns (uint) {
        if (ownership_change[_tokenId] == block.number) return 0;
        return _balanceOfNFT(_tokenId, block.timestamp);
    }
```

## Impact
The protocol or external protocols calling the `balanceOfNFTAt` and `balanceOfNFT` external functions could receive different voting balances for the same veNFT depending on the function called and whether a malicious user executes a flashloan attack within the same block. 

Further, the internal function `_balanceOfNFT` is called by the function `VotingEscrow.getVotes` to compute the voting balance of an account. This function might be used by some external protocols or off-chain components to tally the votes. In such a case, a malicious user could execute a flashloan attack on the veNFT to inflate the voting balance of their account.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The flashloan protection should be implemented across all related functions.
