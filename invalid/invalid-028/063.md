# exercise/exerciseVe/exerciseLp may be oos if the discount is 0.

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens don't allow transfer 0 amount tokens. If the zero fee is transferred to the `treasurys`, the `exercise/exerciseVe/exerciseLp` will be reverted.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Readme, our sponsor mentions the token requirement for Option Token contract. 
```md
Specific contract requirements
Option Token contract
Standard ERC20 - 18 decimal tokens are only allowed ( rebase, fee on transfer and not 18 decimals tokens are not supported)
```
So we can assume that tokens will be supported if they are not rebase, fee on transfer or not 18 decimals.
Some tokens don't allow transfer zero amount, and will be reverted if we try to transfer zero amount.

In exerciseVe()/exerciseLp()/exercise(), the contract will charge some fee and transfer one part of fees to the `treasurys`. 
The vulnerability is that when the `discount` comes to zero, the `paymentAmount` will be zero. When we try to transfer zero fees to the `treasurys`, the transaction will be reverted if payment tokens don't allow transferring zero amount.
The default `discount` value will be between `maxLPDiscount` 20 and `minLPDiscount` 80, and I have confirmed that it's possible to set `discount` to zero. What's more, even if the `discount` is not 0, the final fee to one `treasurys` may be zero because of round down.
One treasury's fee should be `(getTimeWeightedAveragePrice(_amount) * discount) / 100 * treasurys[i].fee/ 100`.
According the the above formula, if the payment price is high compare with FLOW token, discount is low, and the treasury's partition is small, the final fee may be round down to zero even the discount is not zero.
 
```javascript
    function _exercise(
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _maxPaymentAmount,
        address _recipient
    ) internal returns (uint256 paymentAmount) {
        ...
        // Here, amount is oFLOW amount,
        paymentAmount = getDiscountedPrice(_amount);
       ...
    }
    function getDiscountedPrice(uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256) {
        return (getTimeWeightedAveragePrice(_amount) * discount) / 100;
    }
```
```javascript
    function _takeFees(
        address token,
        uint256 paymentAmount
    ) internal returns (uint256 remaining) {
        remaining = paymentAmount;
        for (uint i; i < treasurys.length; i++) {
            uint256 _fee = (paymentAmount * treasurys[i].fee) / 100;
            _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, treasurys[i].treasury, _fee);
            remaining = remaining - _fee;

            if(treasurys[i].notify) {
                IOptionTokenNotify(treasurys[i].treasury).notify(_fee);
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact
The core function `exercise/exerciseVe/exerciseLp` may be out of service.

## Recommendation
If the fee is zero, don't transfer to the treasury.
