# Iota EVM is not compatible with block number

## Summary
There's no enforced average block time in iota EVM  and A new EVM "block" will be created only when an ISC block is created

## Vulnerability Detail
In voting escrow there are quite  number of places where block number is used for some sort of accounting.
```solidity
u_new.blk = block.number;
```

The issue here is that IOTA EVM unlike other EVMs doesn't create blocks in the normal way..  A new EVM "block" will be created only when an ISC block is created.
