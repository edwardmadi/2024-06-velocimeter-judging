# reaching the `_deadline` does not count

## Summary
reaching the deadline does not count
## Vulnerability Detail
In `exercise`, `exerciseLp`, `exerciseVe`, block.timestamp must be greater than the deadline for an error to be raised. However, it is worth including the deadline timestamp itself. Since reaching the deadline itself means that the given time for `exerciseLp` has been exhausted
## Impact
reaching the deadline must be error
