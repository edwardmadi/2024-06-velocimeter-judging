# Prescion loss in getTimeWeightedAveragePrice due to divison

## Summary

The getTimeWeightedAveragePrice function in the OptionTokenV4 contract, suffers from precision loss due to the division which can lead to return of incorrect payment token prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [getTimeWeightedAveragePrice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L372) function suffers from precision loss due to  division here [L387](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L387) 

` return summedAmount / twapPoints;`

The result of the getTimeWeightedAveragePrice function can be affected by a rounding error due to division which will lead to distorted prices of payment token being returned

The getTimeWeightedAveragePrice function result is called directly by getDiscountedPrice and getLpDiscountedPrice also indirectly by getPaymentTokenAmountForExerciseLp this will potentially lead them to returning distorted results

## Impact

The precision loss issues in the function can result in return of inaccurate prices which could in turn affect the result of other functions that relies on it

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a higher precision factor (e.g. 1e18) in calculations to mitigate precision loss
