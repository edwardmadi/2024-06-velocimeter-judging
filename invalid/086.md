# Upgradeable Contract Not Initialized

## Summary
The _'Minter'_ contract was not initialized properly via the initializer function after deploy.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract is an upgradeable contract that should be initialized via an initializer function after deploy, instead of using a constructor. In the existing code, the _'initializer'_ variable is not changed from the constructor caller address, and the _'startActivePeriod()'_ function requires an _'initializer'_ to start the active period.

## Impact
An improperly initialized contract allows a malicious user to take over the contract by exploiting access rights that only the _'initializer'_ should have. This may result in unauthorized changes to critical contract functions, such as changing team addresses, setting team levels, and initiating prize distribution.

## Tool used

- Manual Review
- Foundry

## Recommendation
1. Make sure that the _'Minter'_ contract is initialized correctly using the initializer function after deploy.
2. Add a check in the _'startActivePeriod()'_ function to ensure that the function can only be called by a valid _'initializer'_.
3. Consider using a library like OpenZeppelin's Initializable to ensure that contracts are initialized correctly and only once.

Explanation:
The fact that the test fails on _'setUp()'_ with a _'Revert'_ error indicates that the _'Minter'_ contract was not initialized correctly. In this case, the _'initializer'_ has not been changed from the constructor caller's address, which proves that the contract is not ready for safe use.
