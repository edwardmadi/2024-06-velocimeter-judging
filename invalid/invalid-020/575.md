# `updatePeriod()` distributes a fixed amount of emissions, no matter how much time has passed since the last distribution.

## Summary
The `update_period()` function fails to account for the actual time elapsed when distributing rewards, resulting in users possibly earning fewer rewards than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `update_period()` function is designed to give out rewards. Here's how it works:

- If you call `updatePeriod()` more than a week after the last time rewards were given, it will give out new rewards.
- But, even if you wait two weeks or more to call updatePeriod(), it will still only give out the same amount of rewards as if just one week had passed.
- This can lead to users earning fewer rewards than they would expect.

```solidity
    function update_period() external returns (uint) {
        uint _period = active_period;
        if (block.timestamp >= _period + WEEK && initializer == address(0)) { // only trigger if new week
            _period = (block.timestamp / WEEK) * WEEK;
            active_period = _period;
            uint256 weekly = weekly_emission();

            ...

            _flow.approve(address(_voter), weekly);
            _voter.notifyRewardAmount(weekly);

            emit Mint(msg.sender, weekly, circulating_supply());
        }
        return _period;
    }
```

## Impact
Users may not receive the correct amount of rewards based on the actual time elapsed, leading to potentially lower rewards than anticipated.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    // update period can only be called once per cycle (1 week)
    function update_period() external returns (uint) {
@>>     uint _period = active_period;
@>>     if (block.timestamp >= _period + WEEK && initializer == address(0)) { // only trigger if new week
@>>         _period = (block.timestamp / WEEK) * WEEK;
@>>         active_period = _period;
            uint256 weekly = weekly_emission();

            uint _teamEmissions = (teamRate * weekly) /
                (PRECISION - teamRate);
            uint _required =  weekly + _teamEmissions;
            uint _balanceOf = _flow.balanceOf(address(this));
            if (_balanceOf < _required) {
                _flow.mint(address(this), _required - _balanceOf);
            }

            require(_flow.transfer(teamEmissions, _teamEmissions));

            _checkpointRewardsDistributors();

            _flow.approve(address(_voter), weekly);
            _voter.notifyRewardAmount(weekly);

            emit Mint(msg.sender, weekly, circulating_supply());
        }
        return _period;
    }
```

## Recommendation
Adjust the amount of emissions to the amount of full weeks passed since the last distribution.
