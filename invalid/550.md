# `activeGaugeNumber` could be incremented multiple times for the same gauge within an epoch.


## Vulnerability Detail

 in the `distribute` function:

```solidity
function distribute(address _gauge) public lock {
    IMinter(minter).update_period();
    _updateFor(_gauge); // should set claimable to 0 if killed
    uint _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
    if (_claimable > IGauge(_gauge).left(base) && _claimable / DURATION > 0) {
        claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        if((_claimable * 1e18) / currentEpochRewardAmount > minShareForActiveGauge) {
            activeGaugeNumber += 1;
        }

        IGauge(_gauge).notifyRewardAmount(base, _claimable);
        emit DistributeReward(msg.sender, _gauge, _claimable);
    }
}
```

The bug is in the condition for incrementing the `activeGaugeNumber`:

```solidity
if((_claimable * 1e18) / currentEpochRewardAmount > minShareForActiveGauge) {
    activeGaugeNumber += 1;
}
```


This condition is checked every time `distribute` is called for a gauge, which can lead to the `activeGaugeNumber` being incremented multiple times for the same gauge within an epoch. This could result in an inflated `activeGaugeNumber` that doesn't accurately represent the number of unique active gauges.

To fix this, we should:

1. Keep track of which gauges have been counted as active in the current epoch.
2. Only increment `activeGaugeNumber` if the gauge hasn't been counted as active in this epoch yet.
