# Exercising ve and lp will not give users 100% discount as intended

## Summary

As stated by the sponsor, when exercising option token for lp or ve, users will get 100% discount but they have to wait for a while to claim that amount (lock duration)

> when you choose exercise to LP -> veNFT
> you are getting 100% discount on the FLOW piece 

The problem is that in the current implementation, allowed discount value could only be somewhere between 20% and 80%.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_discount` could only be between minLpDiscount (80) and maxLpDiscount (20):

```solidity
uint256 public  maxLPDiscount = 20; //  User pays 20%
uint256 public  minLPDiscount = 80; //  User pays 80%

if (_discount > minLPDiscount || _discount < maxLPDiscount) 
            revert OptionToken_InvalidDiscount();
```


Therefore it cant be 100, and users still have to pay for underlying token + wait for lock to expire
## Impact
Loss of funds for users, for they have to pay at least 20% of the value (users should not have to pay).
