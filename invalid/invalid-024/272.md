# Incorrect implementation of onERC721Received

## Summary

veNFTs  can be permanently locked, thereby loosing all potential reward and voting power when it is sent to contract that can't handle them

## Vulnerability Detail

The VotingEscrow contract mishandles two critical scenarios; 

1. The _mint function which creates lock doesn't implement the onERC721Received() function. 

2. After a lock has been minted, there is a check in the _safetransferfrom function for sending to a contract. Although, it does execute the onERC721Received(), but it doesn't do a check of the bytes4 variable (it only check for non-zero length).

And according to the [ERC721 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), "When transfer is complete, this function checks if `_to` is a smart contract (code size > 0). If so, it calls onERC721Received` on `_to` and throws if the return value is not 'bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))`."

That means for it to be valid, it must return the bytes4 function selector, otherwise itâ€™s invalid. 

## Impact

1. When minting a lock directly to a contract address, the _mint function performs no compatibility checks whatsoever.

2. If a user transfers a lock to a contract designed to reject NFTs , _safetransferfrom function doesn't verify the correct bytes4 function selector as required by the ERC721 standard and will mistakenly treats this as a successful transfer. This can lead to the NFT being locked forever

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement onERC721Received() in _mint() function and ensure that safeTransferFrom() does a check of the bytes4 function selector
