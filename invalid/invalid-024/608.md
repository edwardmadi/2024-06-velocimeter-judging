# Voting tokens may be lost when given to non-EOA accounts


## Summary
veBVMs can be sent to contracts that cannot handle them, resulting in the permanent locking of all rewards, voting power, and underlying assets.

## Vulnerability Detail
The _mint function which creates the locks, does not perform a check to ensure that the recipient address is capable of handling ERC721 tokens.
This omission means that if veBVMs are sent to a contract that does not implement the ERC721 receiver interface, the tokens, along with their associated rewards and voting power, will be locked in that contract permanently.

## Impact
The failure to perform this check can result in the permanent loss of voting power, rewards, and the underlying assets when veBVMs are sent to non-EOA (Externally Owned Accounts) contracts that cannot handle ERC721 tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, call onERC721Received in the _mint function and ensure that the return value equals IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector. This will ensure that the recipient address is capable of handling ERC721 tokens.
