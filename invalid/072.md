# _checkpointRewardsDistributors can lead to DOS

## Summary
Here's a markdown report based on the template you provided:
Summary
The _checkpointRewardsDistributors() function in the Minter contract is susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to an unbounded loop over an array that can be manipulated by the team.
Vulnerability Detail
The _checkpointRewardsDistributors() function iterates over the _rewards_distributors array, calling checkpoint_token() and checkpoint_total_supply() on each distributor. The team can add an unlimited number of reward distributors using the addRewardsDistributor() function, potentially making this loop too gas-intensive to execute.

## Vulnerability Detail
The _checkpointRewardsDistributors() function iterates over the _rewards_distributors array, calling checkpoint_token() and checkpoint_total_supply() on each distributor. The team can add an unlimited number of reward distributors using the addRewardsDistributor() function, potentially making this loop too gas-intensive to execute.

## Impact
If the _rewards_distributors array becomes too large, it could prevent the update_period() function from executing due to out-of-gas errors. This would block the critical functionality of updating the emission period and distributing rewards, effectively breaking core contract functionality.

POC:
```solidity
function testDoSInCheckpointRewardsDistributors() public {
    // Deploy necessary contracts
    deployBase();
    
    // Add a large number of reward distributors
    for (uint i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        RewardsDistributor newDistributor = new RewardsDistributor(address(escrow));
        minter.addRewardsDistributor(address(newDistributor));
    }
    
    // Try to update period, which will call _checkpointRewardsDistributors
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + WEEK);
    vm.expectRevert("out of gas");
    minter.update_period();
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Implement a maximum limit on the number of reward distributors that can be added.
- Instead of looping through all distributors in a single transaction, implement a mechanism to checkpoint distributors in batches or allow individual checkpointing.
