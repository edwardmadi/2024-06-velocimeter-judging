# Malicious voters can exploit timing discrepancies to receive unearned bribes (`Voter::distribute`)

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract includes a `distribute()` function that is responsible for updating reward amounts for gauges and distributing them. However, there is a critical timing issue in the current implementation that allows voters to exploit the system.

The key components involved are:

1. The [`vote()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L287-L292) function, which allows users to allocate their voting power to different gauges.
2. The bribe system, which rewards voters based on their voting power at the end of each epoch.
3. The [`distribute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L549-L562) function, which updates and distributes rewards to gauges.

The root cause of the issue lies in the timing of the `distribute()` function execution. This function can be called at any time after the epoch ends, which creates a window of opportunity for exploitation. The current implementation allows voters to change their votes after receiving bribes but before the gauge distribution occurs.

The vulnerability arises because:

1. Bribes are awarded based on the voting power at the end of the epoch.
2. The `distribute()` function can be called at any time after the epoch ends.

This desynchronization between bribe payments and gauge distributions leads to an unfair distribution of rewards. Voters can effectively receive bribes without their vote weight influencing the emissions for the bribing protocol, undermining the intended incentive structure of the system.

## Impact
The protocol will suffer from unfair reward distribution, allowing exploiters to receive bribes without contributing to gauge emissions. This misalignment can significantly impact the protocol's tokenomics and intended incentives, leading to financial losses and erosion of trust. Honest users may receive fewer rewards, while exploiters maximize gains, potentially undermining the protocol's ecosystem health and balance.

## Proof of Concept
1. Alice votes for Gauge A for three weeks, accumulating voting power and bribes.
2. At the end of the third week (epoch end), Alice receives bribes based on her voting power for Gauge A.
3. Before the `distribute()` function is called, Alice switches her vote to Gauge B using the `vote()` function.
4. When `distribute()` is finally called, the rewards are distributed based on Alice's new vote for Gauge B, not her previous vote for Gauge A that earned the bribes.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, you guys can implement a post-epoch voting window that restricts vote changes for a short period (e.g., one hour) after the epoch ends. This ensures that distributions occur before voters can change their votes, aligning bribes with emissions.

Here's a suggested implementation:

```diff
// Add a new state variable to track the end of the epoch
uint public epochEndTime;

// Modify the distribute function to update the epoch end time
function distribute(address _gauge) public lock {
    IMinter(minter).update_period();
    _updateFor(_gauge);
    uint _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
    if (_claimable > IGauge(_gauge).left(base) && _claimable / DURATION > 0) {
        claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        if((_claimable * 1e18) / currentEpochRewardAmount > minShareForActiveGauge) {
            activeGaugeNumber += 1;
        }
        IGauge(_gauge).notifyRewardAmount(base, _claimable);
        emit DistributeReward(msg.sender, _gauge, _claimable);
    }
+   epochEndTime = block.timestamp + 1 hours; // Set the end of the epoch to one hour from now
}

// Add a modifier to restrict voting during the post-epoch window
+modifier onlyAfterEpochEnd() {
+   require(block.timestamp > epochEndTime, "Voting is restricted during the post-epoch window");
+   _;
+}

// Apply the modifier to the vote function
-function vote(uint tokenId, address[] calldata _poolVote, uint256[] calldata _weights) external onlyNewEpoch(tokenId) {
+function vote(uint tokenId, address[] calldata _poolVote, uint256[] calldata _weights) external onlyNewEpoch(tokenId) onlyAfterEpochEnd {
    require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, tokenId));
    require(_poolVote.length == _weights.length);
    lastVoted[tokenId] = block.timestamp;
    _vote(tokenId, _poolVote, _weights);
}
```

This modification introduces a time-based constraint that ensures distributions are completed before voters can change their votes, effectively aligning bribes with emissions and preventing the exploitation of the timing discrepancy.
