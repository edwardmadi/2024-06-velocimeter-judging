# Expired locks can be used to claim rewards

## Summary
Expired locks can keep claiming rewards for any bribe.


## Vulnerability Detail
The fix requires checking that block.timestamp is larger than the lock's expiration date when claiming bribes using the `claimBribes` in the `Voter.sol`.
```solidity    
function claimBribes(address[] memory _bribes, address[][] memory _tokens, uint _tokenId) external {
        require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));
        for (uint i = 0; i < _bribes.length; i++) {
            IBribe(_bribes[i]).getRewardForOwner(_tokenId, _tokens[i]);
        }
    }
```
## Impact
Stealing bribe rewards using expired tokens can lead to solvency issues.
