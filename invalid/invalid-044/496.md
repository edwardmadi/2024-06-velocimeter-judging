# Expired locks can be used to claim rewards


## Summary
Expired locks can be used to claim funds leading to protocol insolvency.
Target: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L542C5-L547C6

## Vulnerability Detail
This is very straight foward as `claimBribes()` in voter.sol as seen below does not check and revert if block.timestamp >= lockEnd.

## Impact
- Loss of funds due to theft

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The mitigation requires that we check for expired locks before continuing `claimBribes`
```solidity
    function claimBribes(address[] memory _bribes, address[][] memory _tokens, uint _tokenId) external {
        require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));

        // Add Check here
        for (uint i = 0; i < _bribes.length; i++) {
            IBribe(_bribes[i]).getRewardForOwner(_tokenId, _tokens[i]);
        }
    }
```
