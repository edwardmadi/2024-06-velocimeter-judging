# Expired locks can be used to claim Bribe rewards

## Summary
The `Voter::claimBribes(...)` function is used to claim bribe rewards for tokens (users), however due to missing access control, in the function, a user with expired token can still call `Voter::claimBribes(...)` with their expired token to claim rewards for different bribes not only stealing but also diluting rewards for actively locked users

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown below in the `claimBribes(...)` function, there is no access control checks to ensure that the claimant (`_tokenId`) is still locked, hence a user can create a lock for 1 epoch, and keep claiming rewards forever (even after their lock has expired).
```solidity
File: Voter.sol
546:     function claimBribes(address[] memory _bribes, address[][] memory _tokens, uint _tokenId) external {
547:         require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId)); 
548:         for (uint i = 0; i < _bribes.length; i++) {
549:             IBribe(_bribes[i]).getRewardForOwner(_tokenId, _tokens[i]);
550:         }
551:     }

```

## Impact
Loss of rewards as expired locks can still claim rewards entitled to active locks  leading to loss of rewards for actively locked users.

## Recommendation
Modify the `Voter::claimBribes(...)` function as shown below

```diff
File: Voter.sol
546:     function claimBribes(address[] memory _bribes, address[][] memory _tokens, uint _tokenId) external {
547:         require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId)); 
+            require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).lockEnd(_tokenId) < block.timestamp, "token expired");
548:         for (uint i = 0; i < _bribes.length; i++) {
549:             IBribe(_bribes[i]).getRewardForOwner(_tokenId, _tokens[i]);
550:         }
551:     }

```
