# Users will be unable to exercise options with valid discounts due to incorrect validation in `OptionTokenV4::_exerciseLp` and `OptionTokenV4::_exerciseVe`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail 

The [`OptionTokenV4`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol) contract implements functionality for users to exercise options tokens to purchase underlying tokens or create LP positions. Two key functions, [`_exerciseLp()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L652-L716) and [`_exerciseVe()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L593-L650), allow users to exercise options with specific discounts. These discounts are meant to be constrained within a range defined by [`minLPDiscount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L146) and [`maxLPDiscount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L145).

However, the current implementation of the discount validation logic in both functions is flawed. The validation check uses an incorrect logical condition:

```solidity
if (_discount > minLPDiscount || _discount < maxLPDiscount)
    revert OptionToken_InvalidDiscount();
```

This condition inadvertently rejects valid discounts that fall within the intended range (between `maxLPDiscount` and `minLPDiscount`) while potentially accepting some invalid discounts outside this range.

The issue stems from a simple but critical logical error in the comparison operators. As a result, users attempting to exercise options with valid discounts will have their transactions reverted, effectively breaking the core functionality of the contract.

## Impact
The incorrect discount validation logic renders the option exercising functionality unusable for all valid discount values. Users will be unable to exercise their options as intended, potentially leading to financial losses if they cannot act on their options at crucial times. This bug severely undermines the contract's primary purpose and could result in a loss of user trust in the protocol.

## Proof of Concept
1. Alice holds option tokens and wants to exercise them to create an LP position.
2. The current `minLPDiscount` is set to 80, and `maxLPDiscount` is set to 20.
3. Alice calls `exerciseLp()` with a valid discount of 50 (which is between 20 and 80).
4. The function internally calls `_exerciseLp()`, which checks the discount:
   ```solidity
   if (50 > 80 || 50 < 20)  // This evaluates to true
       revert OptionToken_InvalidDiscount();
   ```
5. The transaction reverts, and Alice is unable to exercise her options despite using a valid discount.

The same issue occurs in the `_exerciseVe()` function, affecting the `exerciseVe()` functionality as well.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendation
The discount validation logic should be corrected in both `_exerciseLp()` and `_exerciseVe()` functions. The fix involves reversing the comparison operators:

```diff
function _exerciseLp(
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _maxPaymentAmount,
    address _recipient,
    uint256 _discount
) internal returns (uint256 paymentAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
    if (isPaused) revert OptionToken_Paused();
    if (isExerciseLpPaused) revert OptionToken_Paused();

-   if (_discount > minLPDiscount || _discount < maxLPDiscount)
+   if (_discount < minLPDiscount || _discount > maxLPDiscount)
        revert OptionToken_InvalidDiscount();
    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```

Apply the same change to the `_exerciseVe()` function. This correction ensures that only discounts within the valid range (between `maxLPDiscount` and `minLPDiscount`) are accepted, restoring the intended functionality of the contract.
