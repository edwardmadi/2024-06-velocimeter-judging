# Vulnerability to Fee-on-Transfer Token Accounting Issues

## Summary
The _'_deposit_for'_ function in the contract does not take into account tokens that implement a fee-on-transfer mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail
The _'_deposit_for'_ function facilitates the deposit of tokens into the contract and adjusts the locked balance accordingly. However, this function does not currently take into account tokens that implement a fee-on-transfer mechanism. In such cases, the amount transferred is less than the specified amount due to reduced fees. Without measuring the contract balance before and after the transfer, the contract may incorrectly assume that the full amount has been transferred, leading to incorrect updates to the user's total supply and locked balance.

## Impact
1. Improper supply accounting, which can impact the integrity of contract logic and cause inconsistencies in token balances.
2. Potential exploitation by users who may deposit less than the required amount due to fee-on-transfer, while the contract records a higher amount.

## Recommendation
Modify the _'_deposit_for'_ function to measure the contract balance before and after transfer to ensure that the correct amount of tokens has been deposited.
