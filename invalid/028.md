## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
in Flow.sol contract the transferFrom function dosent validate the input of _from address,it doesnt check that the _from address has enough balance.

also the internal _transfer function doesnt do that

also the User can transfer to zero address by mistake , while there is `burn` function if he need to.
## Impact
it will fail without a revert message that show the caller what was the error.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a input check with clear error message like :
```solidity
require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");
```
