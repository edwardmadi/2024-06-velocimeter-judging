# Users will not be able to claim their complete rewards

## Summary
The `RewardsDistributor::claim()` function does not always claim all of the pending rewards for a given tokenId. This is because the `_claim()` function has a finite for loop that does 50 iterations. This can lead to a permanent freezing of unclaimed yield if a user locks for 52 weeks and only claims rewards after their lock ends.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users have the liberty of locking their tokens for up to 52 weeks. But before they withdraw, they first call `RewardsDistributor::claim()` and then `VotingEscrow::withdraw(...)` which burns the token entirely

However, using a 50 loop iteration within the `_claim()` function for calculation of claimable rewards, can be insufficient for claiming all of the user's unclaimed rewards. This is because the `tokens_per_week` is updated in the `_checkpoint_token()` function every week when the keeper distributes emissions, hence the user will get rewards due for 50 weeks instead of 52 weeks.

- Alice lock her token for 52 weeks without touching it or claiming rewards
- At the beginning of the 54th weeks she has accrued rewards and she calls `claim(...)` which calls `_claim(...)` internally
- the `tokens_per_week[week_cursor] ` has been updated during distribution up until at least the 52nd week
- unfortunately, since the iteration is going to return rewards earned by Alice from only 50 of the 52 `tokens_per_week[week_cursor] ` distributed, Alice would loose rewards from the last 2 weeks of her lock period
- Alice calls withdraw with her token and she forgoes her entitled rewards from the last 2 weeks

This also affects the `_claimable(...)` and `claimable(...)` functions respectively as they could be used by external protocols which makes them susceptible to the same vulnerability

## Impact
This can lead to loss of reward for users with the unclaimed portion likely stuck in the contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider 
- modifying the `RewardsDistributor::_claim()` function to ensure that the rewards can be accrued beyond 50 weeks but not above the the lock period of their token.
- putting the claim function only inside `withdraw(...)` and the iteration should be done only for the amount of time the user locked their token and not beyond because that would open another path for theft.

Also there should be a mechanism for tracking the users who constantly call claim whether or not they lock for max period or not.
