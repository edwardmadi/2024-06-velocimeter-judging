# Incorrect reward rate calculation in `GaugeV4::notifyRewardAmount` will deplete reward pool prematurely, affecting late claimers

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `GaugeV4` contract implements a staking and reward distribution system where users can stake tokens and earn rewards over time. The [`notifyRewardAmount()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/GaugeV4.sol#L563-L599) function is responsible for adding new rewards to the pool and calculating the rate at which these rewards should be distributed.

The core issue lies in the calculation of `rewardRate[token]` within the `notifyRewardAmount()` function. This rate determines how quickly rewards are distributed to stakers. Currently, the function uses a fixed `DURATION` (7 days) to calculate the rate, regardless of the actual time remaining until the next reward period ends.

The problematic calculations occur in two places:

```solidity
rewardRate[token] = amount / DURATION;
```

and

```solidity
rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / DURATION;
```

This approach leads to an inflated reward rate when new rewards are added close to the end of a period, causing the reward pool to deplete faster than intended. As a result, early claimers may receive a disproportionately large share of rewards, while late claimers might find the pool empty when they attempt to claim.

The highest impact scenario occurs when a large amount of rewards is added near the end of a distribution period, causing the reward rate to spike dramatically and potentially depleting the entire reward pool before the intended distribution period ends.

## Impact

The incorrect reward rate calculation leads to an unfair distribution of rewards among stakers. Early claimers can receive more rewards than intended, while late claimers may be unable to claim any rewards due to premature depletion of the reward pool. 

## Proof of Concept

1. Alice and Bob both stake 1000 tokens in the `GaugeV4` contract at t=0.
2. At t=6 days (1 day before the end of the reward period), the admin calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with 1000 DAI.
3. The function calculates `rewardRate[token] = 1000 / (7 days)`, which is much higher than it should be for the remaining 1 day.
4. Alice claims her rewards shortly after, receiving nearly all 1000 DAI due to the inflated reward rate.
5. At t=7 days, Bob attempts to claim his rewards but finds the pool depleted, receiving little to no rewards despite staking for the same duration as Alice.

Manual review

## Recommendation

To fix this issue, the `notifyRewardAmount()` function should calculate the reward rate based on the actual remaining time until the next period finish, rather than using a fixed duration. Here's a diff of the proposed changes:

```diff
function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
    // ... existing code ...

+   uint nextPeriodFinish = block.timestamp + DURATION;
+   uint timeUntilNextPeriodFinish = nextPeriodFinish - block.timestamp;

    if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish[token]) {
        // ... existing code ...
-       rewardRate[token] = amount / DURATION;
+       rewardRate[token] = amount / timeUntilNextPeriodFinish;
    } else {
        // ... existing code ...
-       rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / DURATION;
+       rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / timeUntilNextPeriodFinish;
    }

    // ... existing code ...

-   require(rewardRate[token] <= balance / DURATION, "Provided reward too high");
+   require(rewardRate[token] <= balance / timeUntilNextPeriodFinish, "Provided reward too high");
-   periodFinish[token] = block.timestamp + DURATION;
+   periodFinish[token] = nextPeriodFinish;

    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```
