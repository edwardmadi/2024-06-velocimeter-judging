# Users can manipulate voting power through incorrect checkpointing in `VotingEscrow::increase_unlock_time()`

## Summary
The `VotingEscrow` contract implements a system where users can lock their tokens for a certain period to gain voting power. This voting power can be delegated to other users, creating a delegation chain. The contract includes functions to manage these locks, including `increase_unlock_time()`, which allows users to extend the lock duration of their tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The core issue lies in the implementation of the `increase_unlock_time()` function. This function is responsible for updating the lock duration of tokens, which should result in an update to the associated voting power. However, the function does not directly call the `_checkpoint()` function, which is crucial for correctly calculating and updating voting power.

Instead, `increase_unlock_time()` relies on the `_deposit_for()` function to indirectly trigger the checkpointing process. This indirect approach fails to properly account for delegated tokens and delegation chains, leading to potential inaccuracies in voting power calculations.

The root cause of this issue is in the `increase_unlock_time()` function:

```solidity
function increase_unlock_time(uint _tokenId, uint _lock_duration) external nonreentrant {
    assert(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId)); 

    LockedBalance memory _locked = locked[_tokenId];
    uint unlock_time = (block.timestamp + _lock_duration) / WEEK * WEEK;

    require(_locked.end > block.timestamp, 'Lock expired');
    require(_locked.amount > 0, 'Nothing is locked');
    require(unlock_time > _locked.end, 'Can only increase lock duration');
    require(unlock_time <= block.timestamp + MAXTIME, 'Voting lock can be 52 weeks max');

    _deposit_for(_tokenId, 0, unlock_time, _locked, DepositType.INCREASE_UNLOCK_TIME);
}
```

Here, `_locked` is passed directly to `_deposit_for()`, but it already contains the new unlock time. As a result, when `_checkpoint()` is called within `_deposit_for()`, it doesn't have the correct old lock information to accurately calculate the changes in voting power.

## Impact
The incorrect checkpointing in the `increase_unlock_time()` function can lead to inaccurate calculation and distribution of voting power throughout the system. This vulnerability allows users to potentially manipulate their voting power by strategically increasing lock times without proper checkpointing. 

The highest impact scenario occurs in a delegation chain. For example, if User A delegates to User B, who then delegates to User C, and User B increases their lock time, the voting power updates may not propagate correctly through the chain. This could lead to User C having incorrect voting power, potentially allowing for manipulation of the governance system.

## Proof of Concept
1. User A locks 100 tokens and delegates to User B.
2. User B locks 50 tokens and delegates to User C.
3. User C locks 25 tokens.
4. User B calls `increase_unlock_time()` to extend their lock duration.
5. The `_checkpoint()` function is not called directly, leading to incorrect updates in the delegation chain.
6. User C now has incorrect voting power, which doesn't accurately reflect the increased lock time of User B's delegated tokens.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, call the `_checkpoint()` function within `increase_unlock_time()` before calling `_deposit_for()`. This ensures that the voting power is correctly updated for both the user increasing the lock time and any users in the delegation chain. Here's the possible fix:

```diff
function increase_unlock_time(uint _tokenId, uint _lock_duration) external nonreentrant {
    assert(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId)); 

    LockedBalance memory _locked = locked[_tokenId];
    uint unlock_time = (block.timestamp + _lock_duration) / WEEK * WEEK;

    require(_locked.end > block.timestamp, 'Lock expired');
    require(_locked.amount > 0, 'Nothing is locked');
    require(unlock_time > _locked.end, 'Can only increase lock duration');
    require(unlock_time <= block.timestamp + MAXTIME, 'Voting lock can be 52 weeks max');

+   // Explicitly call _checkpoint to update voting power
+   _checkpoint(_tokenId, _locked, LockedBalance(_locked.amount, unlock_time));

    _deposit_for(_tokenId, 0, unlock_time, _locked, DepositType.INCREASE_UNLOCK_TIME);
}
```

This change ensures that the `_checkpoint()` function receives the correct old and new lock information, allowing for accurate calculation of voting power changes.
