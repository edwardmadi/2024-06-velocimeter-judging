# Unupdated `FULL_LOCK` will make `exerciseVe()` function uncallable

## Summary
According to the contest README `MAXTIME` constant in `VotingEscrow` contract will be updated before deployment to some chains. However, there is no mention of updating the `FULL_LOCK` constant in `OptionTokenV4` to the same value as `MAXTIME`. `FULL_LOCK` is used to initialize the `lockDurationForMaxLpDiscount` variable:
```solidity
    uint256 public lockDurationForMaxLpDiscount = FULL_LOCK; // 52 weeks
```
Moreover, in the deployment script `oFLOW.setLockDurationForMaxLpDiscount(52 * 7 * 86400)` is called proving further that this is the value which will be used for this variable. 
## Vulnerability Detail
`lockDurationForMaxLpDiscount` is used to calculate the slope and intercept for the lp discount curve. More importantly, when the `_discount` in `_exerciseVe()` has max value, the lock time is equal to `FULL_LOCK`:
```solidity
function getLockDurationForLpDiscount(
        uint256 _discount
    ) public view returns (uint256 duration) {
        (int256 slope, int256 intercept) = getSlopeInterceptForLpDiscount();
        duration = _discount == 0
@>          ? lockDurationForMaxLpDiscount
            : SignedMath.abs(slope * int256(_discount) + intercept);
    }
```
Eventually, in the `_exerciseVe()` function `VotingEscrow::create_lock_for()` is called, where the following check is enforced on the `_lock_duration` passed as a parameter:
```solidity
require(unlock_time <= block.timestamp + MAXTIME,"Voting lock can be 52 weeks max");
```
## Impact
Due to this discrepancy between two constant variables accounting for the same invariant exercising oFLOW to veNFT becomes impossible with max discount - the `_create_lock()` function always reverts on the require statement.

## Recommendation
Update `FULL_LOCK` to the same value as `MAXTIME` on deployments to different chains.
