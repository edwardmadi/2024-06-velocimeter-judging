# Stakers will receive excessive rewards due to incorrect calculation in `GaugeV4::rewardPerToken()` and `GaugeV4::earned()`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`GaugeV4`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/GaugeV4.sol) contract implements a staking and reward distribution system where users can stake tokens and earn rewards over time. Two critical functions in this system are [`rewardPerToken()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/GaugeV4.sol#L305-L310) and [`earned()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/GaugeV4.sol#L411-L437). 

The `rewardPerToken()` function calculates the amount of reward tokens earned per staked token, considering the time elapsed since the last update, the current reward rate, and the total supply of staked tokens. The `earned()` function then uses this calculation to determine the total rewards earned by a specific user.

However, there is a significant flaw in the implementation of these functions. The current logic does not properly handle the transition between reward periods, allowing for the retroactive application of rewards from previous periods. This can lead to an overestimation of rewards, potentially resulting in users being able to claim more rewards than they are actually entitled to.

The root cause of the issue lies in the `rewardPerToken()` function:

```solidity
function rewardPerToken(address token) public view returns (uint) {
    if (derivedSupply == 0) {
        return rewardPerTokenStored[token];
    }
    return rewardPerTokenStored[token] + ((lastTimeRewardApplicable(token) - Math.min(lastUpdateTime[token], periodFinish[token])) * rewardRate[token] * PRECISION / derivedSupply);
}
```

This calculation does not account for the possibility that `lastTimeRewardApplicable(token)` could be in a new reward period, while `lastUpdateTime[token]` is in a previous period. As a result, rewards from the previous period can be incorrectly applied to the current period.

The `earned()` function compounds this issue by relying on the potentially inflated `rewardPerToken()` value:

```solidity
function earned(address token, address account) public view returns (uint) {
    // ... (earlier code omitted for brevity)
    reward += cp.balanceOf * (rewardPerToken(token) - Math.max(_rewardPerTokenStored, userRewardPerTokenStored[token][account])) / PRECISION;
    return reward;
}
```

In the worst-case scenario, this could lead to a situation where the total rewards claimed by users exceed the actual rewards allocated to the contract, potentially causing it to become insolvent and unable to fulfill future reward claims.

## Impact

The incorrect calculation in `rewardPerToken()` and `earned()` functions leads to an overestimation of rewards for stakers. This results in an unfair distribution of rewards, where early claimants can receive more tokens than they should, depleting the reward pool for later claimants. Over time, this can lead to the insolvency of the contract, as it may not have enough tokens to fulfill all reward claims.

## Proof of Concept

1. Alice stakes 1000 tokens in the `GaugeV4` contract at the beginning of a reward period.
2. The reward period is set to 7 days, with a total of 7000 reward tokens to be distributed (1000 tokens per day).
3. After 7 days, a new reward period begins, but the contract is not immediately updated.
4. Alice calls `earned()` to check her rewards. Due to the retroactive application bug, the function calculates her rewards based on the entire previous period plus the time elapsed in the new period.
5. Instead of receiving 7000 tokens (her fair share for the completed period), Alice is able to claim significantly more, potentially up to 8000 or 9000 tokens if several days have passed in the new period.
6. Alice withdraws these excess rewards using the `getReward()` function, which internally calls `earned()`:

```solidity
function getReward(address account, address[] memory tokens) external lock {
    // ... (earlier code omitted for brevity)
    uint _reward = earned(tokens[i], account);
    // ... (remaining code omitted for brevity)
}
```

7. This leaves fewer rewards available for other stakers or for future distributions.
8. Bob, who staked the same amount as Alice but claims his rewards later, receives fewer tokens than expected due to the depleted reward pool.
9. This process can be repeated, potentially leading to contract insolvency over time.

## Tools Used

Manual review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, the `rewardPerToken()` function should be modified to ensure that rewards are only calculated within the current period. Here's a suggested fix:

```diff
function rewardPerToken(address token) public view returns (uint) {
    if (derivedSupply == 0) {
        return rewardPerTokenStored[token];
    }
+   uint lastApplicableTime = lastTimeRewardApplicable(token);
+   uint lastUpdate = Math.min(lastUpdateTime[token], periodFinish[token]);
+   if (lastApplicableTime > lastUpdate) {
+       return rewardPerTokenStored[token] + ((lastApplicableTime - lastUpdate) * rewardRate[token] * PRECISION / derivedSupply);
+   }
+   return rewardPerTokenStored[token];
-   return rewardPerTokenStored[token] + ((lastTimeRewardApplicable(token) - Math.min(lastUpdateTime[token], periodFinish[token])) * rewardRate[token] * PRECISION / derivedSupply);
}
```

Additionally, you guys can implement a mechanism to properly handle the transition between reward periods. This could involve creating a new function to finalize the current period and initialize the next one, updating all relevant state variables in the process. For an example:

```solidity
function finalizeRewardPeriod(address token) external onlyOwner {
    require(block.timestamp >= periodFinish[token], "Current period not finished");
    
    // Update stored rewards
    rewardPerTokenStored[token] = rewardPerToken(token);
    lastUpdateTime[token] = block.timestamp;
    
    // Start new period
    periodFinish[token] = block.timestamp + DURATION;
    
    // Additional logic for new period initialization
}
```
