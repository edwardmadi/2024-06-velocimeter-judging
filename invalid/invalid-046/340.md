# The timestamp variable of a checkpoint is not initialized

## Summary
The `timestamp` variable of a checkpoint is not initialized in the `VotingEscrow.sol`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In VotingEscrow.sol file, there is a checkpoint structure.
```solidity
    /// @notice A checkpoint for marking delegated tokenIds from a given timestamp
    struct Checkpoint {
        uint timestamp;
        uint[] tokenIds;
    }
   ...
   mapping(address => mapping(uint32 => Checkpoint)) public checkpoints;
```

But there is no initializing code for checkpoint's `timestamp` variable anywhere in the codebase.
Therefore, any function that relies on the `timestamp` of a checkpoint will break.
In VotingEscrow contract, there are two functions to rely on the `timestamp` variable of a checkpoint for computation.

```solidity

function getPastVotesIndex(address account, uint timestamp) public view returns (uint32) {
  ...
  // Next check implicit zero balance
>>  if (checkpoints[account][0].timestamp > timestamp) {
    return 0;
  }
  ...
}
...
function _findWhatCheckpointToWrite(address account)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint32)
{
...
  if (
    _nCheckPoints > 0 &&
>>    checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].timestamp == _timestamp
  ) {
    return _nCheckPoints - 1;
  } else {
    return _nCheckPoints;
  }
...
}
```

## Impact
 The `timestamp` variable of a checkpoint is not initialized

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialize the `timestamp` variable of the checkpoint in the codebase.
