# Uninitialized Checkpoint Timestamp in VotingEscrow Contract

## Summary
The VotingEscrow contract uses checkpoints to track voting power over time, but the timestamp field of these checkpoints is not properly initialized when creating new checkpoints. This can lead to issues with voting power calculations and inconsistent behavior in functions that rely on these timestamps.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the provided VotingEscrow contract, checkpoints are used to track changes in voting power. However, the timestamp field of these checkpoints is not explicitly set when creating new checkpoints. This is similar to the issue in the Spearbit report where the fromBlock variable was not initialized.
The problematic areas are in the _moveTokenDelegates and _moveAllDelegates functions, where new checkpoints are created without setting the timestamp:

## Impact
* Incorrect voting power calculations: Functions that rely on checkpoint timestamps (like getPastVotes) may return incorrect results.
* Inconsistent behavior: The _findWhatCheckpointToWrite function may not work as intended, always creating new checkpoints instead of updating existing ones.
* Potential vulnerabilities in governance mechanisms that rely on accurate historical voting power.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _findWhatCheckpointToWrite(address account) internal view returns (uint32) {
    uint _timestamp = block.timestamp;
    uint32 _nCheckPoints = numCheckpoints[account];

    if (_nCheckPoints > 0 && checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].timestamp == _timestamp) {
        return _nCheckPoints - 1;
    } else {
        return _nCheckPoints;
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialize the timestamp field when creating new checkpoints:
```solidity
function _moveTokenDelegates(address srcRep, address dstRep, uint _tokenId) internal {
    // ... (other code)
    uint32 nextSrcRepNum = _findWhatCheckpointToWrite(srcRep);
    checkpoints[srcRep][nextSrcRepNum].timestamp = block.timestamp;
    uint[] storage srcRepNew = checkpoints[srcRep][nextSrcRepNum].tokenIds;
    // ... (other code)
}
```
* Apply similar changes to the _moveAllDelegates function.
* Review and update all functions that create or modify checkpoints to ensure they properly set the timestamp field.
* Consider adding a function to validate and potentially fix historical checkpoints if any exist without proper timestamps.
