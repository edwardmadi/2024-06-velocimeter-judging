# The `timestamp` variable of Checkpoint not initialized

## Summary
A Checkpoint contains a `timestamp` variable which stores the `timestamp` the checkpoint is created. But it is not initialized in the codebase.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `timestamp` variable of a checkpoint was not initialized anywhere in the codebase. Therefore, any function that relies on the `timestamp` of a checkpoint will break.

The `VotingEscrow._findWhatCheckpointToWrite` and `VotingEscrow.getPastVotesIndex` functions were found
to rely on the `timestamp` variable of a checkpoint for computation. The following is a list of functions that calls
these two affected functions.

```solidity
_findWhatCheckpointToWrite -> _moveTokenDelegates -> _transferFrom
_findWhatCheckpointToWrite -> _moveTokenDelegates -> _mint
_findWhatCheckpointToWrite -> _moveTokenDelegates -> _burn
_findWhatCheckpointToWrite -> _moveAllDelegates   -> _delegate -> delegate/delegateBySig
getPastVotesIndex          -> getTokenIdsAt
getPastVotesIndex          -> getPastVotes        -> GovernorSimpleVotes._getVotes
```


## Impact
- `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` -> This function does not work as intended and will always return the index of a new checkpoint.
- `getPastVotesIndex` -> This function is intended to fetch the corresponding checkpoint index based on the given `timestamp` but due to missing timestamp initialization this function will always returns recent checkpoint index.
Due to this the function `getPastVotes` will always return current voting power, making the functions serve wrong purpose.

```solidity
   function getPastVotesIndex(address account, uint timestamp) public view returns (uint32) {
        uint32 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[account];
        if (nCheckpoints == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        // First check most recent balance
@>        if (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints - 1].timestamp <= timestamp) {
@>            return (nCheckpoints - 1);
@>        }

        // Next check implicit zero balance
        if (checkpoints[account][0].timestamp > timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint32 lower = 0;
        uint32 upper = nCheckpoints - 1;
        while (upper > lower) {
            uint32 center = upper - (upper - lower) / 2; // ceil, avoiding overflow
            Checkpoint storage cp = checkpoints[account][center];
            if (cp.timestamp == timestamp) {
                return center;
            } else if (cp.timestamp < timestamp) {
                lower = center;
            } else {
                upper = center - 1;
            }
        }
        return lower;
    }
```

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    /// @notice A checkpoint for marking delegated tokenIds from a given timestamp
    struct Checkpoint {
        uint timestamp;
        uint[] tokenIds;
    }
```

## Recommendation
Initialize the `timestamp` variable of the checkpoint in the codebase.
