# The timestamp variable of checkpoint is uninitialized

## Summary

The VotingEscrow contract contains an uninitialized variable `timestamp`  in Checkpoint struct which could lead to significant malfunctions in the contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The Checkpoint struct includes a timestamp variable, intended to store the block timestamp when the checkpoint is created. 

`struct Checkpoint {
        uint timestamp;
        uint[] tokenIds;
    }`

However, the timestamp is never initialized in the VotingEscrow contract , leading to potential malfunctions in several key functions.


This can be seen in two places: 

1. The [_findWhatCheckpointToWrite](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1413) function

This function checks if the timestamp of the latest checkpoint for an account matches the current block timestamp. Due to the lack of initialization, this check will always fail, causing the function to consistently return the index for a new checkpoint rather than updating an existing one.

```diff

function _findWhatCheckpointToWrite(address account) internal view returns (uint32) {
    uint _timestamp = block.timestamp;
    uint32 _nCheckPoints = numCheckpoints[account];
    if (_nCheckPoints > 0 && checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].timestamp == _timestamp) {
        return _nCheckPoints - 1;
    } else {
        return _nCheckPoints;
    }
}

```


2. The [getPastVotesIndex](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1306) function

This function uses the Checkpoint timestamp for optimization in retrieving past votes. The uninitialized timestamp prevents this optimization from working correctly, potentially affecting vote counting and historical vote queries.

```diff

function getPastVotesIndex(address account, uint timestamp) public view returns (uint32) {
        uint32 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[account];
        if (nCheckpoints == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        // First check most recent balance
        if (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints - 1].timestamp <= timestamp) {
            return (nCheckpoints - 1);
        }

        // Next check implicit zero balance
        if (checkpoints[account][0].timestamp > timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint32 lower = 0;
        uint32 upper = nCheckpoints - 1;
        while (upper > lower) {
            uint32 center = upper - (upper - lower) / 2; // ceil, avoiding overflow
            Checkpoint storage cp = checkpoints[account][center];
            if (cp.timestamp == timestamp) {
                return center;
            } else if (cp.timestamp < timestamp) {
                lower = center;
            } else {
                upper = center - 1;
            }
        }
        return lower;
    }
```

## Impact

The functions relying on  _findWhatCheckpointToWrite and getPastVotesIndex will be severely affected
