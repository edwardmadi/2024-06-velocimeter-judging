# Users can't claim rewards when `totalWeight` is zero

## Summary

The `Voter.notifyRewardAmount` function updates the `index` variable. When `totalWeight` is zero, calling this function is reverted.
As a result, users can't claim rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

When users claim rewards from `Gauge` contract, it calls `Voter.notifyRewardAmount` function.
In this function, it increases `index` value.

```solidity
        function notifyRewardAmount(uint amount) external {
            require(msg.sender == minter,"not a minter");
            activeGaugeNumber = 0;
            currentEpochRewardAmount = amount;
            _safeTransferFrom(base, msg.sender, address(this), amount); // transfer the distro in
L490        uint256 _ratio = amount * 1e18 / totalWeight; // 1e18 adjustment is removed during claim
            if (_ratio > 0) {
                index += _ratio;
            }
            emit NotifyReward(msg.sender, base, amount);
        }
```

If nobody votes, `totalWeight` is zero and calculating `_ratio` will be reverted.
As a result, getting rewards for users can be DoS.

## Impact

Users can't claim rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to change the code as following:
```diff
        function notifyRewardAmount(uint amount) external {
+           if (totalWeight)
+               return;
            require(msg.sender == minter,"not a minter");
            activeGaugeNumber = 0;
            currentEpochRewardAmount = amount;
            _safeTransferFrom(base, msg.sender, address(this), amount); // transfer the distro in
            uint256 _ratio = amount * 1e18 / totalWeight; // 1e18 adjustment is removed during claim
            if (_ratio > 0) {
                index += _ratio;
            }
            emit NotifyReward(msg.sender, base, amount);
        }
```
