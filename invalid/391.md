# Lack of expiryCooldownTime Enforcement in `_exerciseVe` Function before `_burn`

## Summary
The _exerciseVe function in the OptionToken contract lacks enforcement of the `expiryCooldownTime` before burning tokens. This can lead to premature token burning, giving unfair advantages to some users and violating the intended token lifecycle. To mitigate this, a check should be added to ensure the expiryCooldownTime has elapsed before proceeding with the burn operation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The absence of a check for the `expiryCooldownTime` before burning tokens can lead to premature burning of tokens. This bypasses the intended cooldown period, potentially resulting in unfair advantages for some users and violating the designed token lifecycle.

## Proof of Concept:

As stated above

```javascript
/// @notice the time period required to be waited before we can burn the tokens
    uint256 public immutable expiryCooldownTime;
```

Current Function (Vulnerable to Premature Burning):

```javascript
function _exerciseVe(
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _maxPaymentAmount,
    uint256 _discount,
    address _recipient
)
    internal
    returns (uint256 paymentAmount, uint256 nftId, uint256 lpAmount)
{
    if (isPaused) revert OptionToken_Paused();
    if (isExerciseVePaused) revert OptionToken_Paused();

    if (_discount > minLPDiscount || _discount < maxLPDiscount)
        revert OptionToken_InvalidDiscount();

    // burn callers tokens
    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);

    // Other logic...
}
```

## Problem:

There is no check to ensure that the required `expiryCooldownTime` has passed before burning the tokens.

Example Scenario:

Alice owns some option tokens.
The system requires a cooldown period of `1 week (expiryCooldownTime)` before these tokens can be burned.
Alice initiates `_exerciseVe` which does not wait for the cooldown period before burn.
Tokens are burned immediately, bypassing the cooldown.


## Impact
Tokens can be burned before the intended cooldown period, disrupting the designed token lifecycle.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
 /// @notice the time period required to be waited before we can burn the tokens
    uint256 public immutable expiryCooldownTime;
```
Burn does not ensure the expiryCooldownTime has passed

```javascript
  function burn(uint256 _amount) external onlyAdmin {
        // transfer underlying tokens to the caller
        _safeTransfer(underlyingToken, msg.sender, _amount);
        // burn option tokens
        _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure that the `expiryCooldownTime` has passed before allowing the burn operation.
