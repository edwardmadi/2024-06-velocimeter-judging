# Improper Use of `assert` for Input Validation in `checkpoint_token` Function

krkbaa
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
in RewardsDistributor.sol contract the `checkpoint_token` function uses the assert statement to validate that the msg.sender is equal to the depositor
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributor.sol#L98-L101
If an assert statement fails, it consumes all the gas provided to the transaction, which can be very costly
## Impact
loss of funds (gas costs) for the caller.
