# Missing of dupplication check in `Voter.sol#addFactory()` function

## Summary
The `removeFactory()` function may be reverted due to Missing of dupplication check in `Voter.sol#addFactory()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Voter.sol` pairFactory and gaugeFactory is created and removed using `addFactory()` and `removeFactory()`
```solidity
    function addFactory(address _pairFactory, address _gaugeFactory) external onlyEmergencyCouncil {
        require(_pairFactory != address(0), 'addr 0');
        require(_gaugeFactory != address(0), 'addr 0');
-->     require(!isGaugeFactory[_gaugeFactory], 'g.fact true');

        factories.push(_pairFactory);
        gaugeFactories.push(_gaugeFactory);
        isFactory[_pairFactory] = true;
        isGaugeFactory[_gaugeFactory] = true;

        emit FactoryAdded(msg.sender, _pairFactory, _gaugeFactory);
    }
```
```solidity
    function removeFactory(uint256 _pos) external onlyEmergencyCouncil {
        require(_pos < factoryLength() && _pos < gaugeFactoriesLength(), '_pos out of range');
        address oldPF = factories[_pos];
        address oldGF = gaugeFactories[_pos];
        require(isFactory[oldPF], 'factory false');
        require(isGaugeFactory[oldGF], 'g.fact false');
        factories[_pos] = address(0);
        gaugeFactories[_pos] = address(0);
        isFactory[oldPF] = false;
        isGaugeFactory[oldGF] = false;

        emit FactoryRemoved(msg.sender, _pos);
    }
```
As you can see, in the provided code snippet, only the check for `_gaugeFactory` is performed, and the check for `_pairFactory` is not performed.

Now let's implement the following scenario.
1) Execute addFactory(0x123, 0x456). At that time pos is 4.
2) After long time, execute addFactory(0x123, 0x789). At that time pos is 30.
3) Execute removeFactory(4)."isFactory[0x123] = false"
4) Execute removeFactory(30) and then occur revert.
The basic cause of the problem is that `addFactory()` does not perform a duplicate check.

## Impact
The `removeFactory()` function may not work as intended, and as a result, if the factory is abused or similar, it may not be removed unexpectedly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `addFactory()` in `Voter.sol` has to be modified as follows.
```solidity
    function addFactory(address _pairFactory, address _gaugeFactory) external onlyEmergencyCouncil {
        require(_pairFactory != address(0), 'addr 0');
        require(_gaugeFactory != address(0), 'addr 0');
        require(!isGaugeFactory[_gaugeFactory], 'g.fact true');
+++     require(!isFactory[_pairFactory], 'factory false');   

        factories.push(_pairFactory);
        gaugeFactories.push(_gaugeFactory);
        isFactory[_pairFactory] = true;
        isGaugeFactory[_gaugeFactory] = true;

        emit FactoryAdded(msg.sender, _pairFactory, _gaugeFactory);
    }
```
