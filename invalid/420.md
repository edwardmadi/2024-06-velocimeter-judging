# `amountOutMin` for intermediate, not final amount

## Summary
`amountOutMin is useless to the user

## Vulnerability Detail
A swap can execute multipleoperations before returning the final amount of tokens to the user. 
`swapExactTokensForTokenSimple`, `swapExactTokensForTokens`  in Router.sol  call `_swap` => `Pair.swap()` , in which funds are sent to the user , already without slippage control, since `amountOutMin` only applies to the transferFrom in functions of Router.sol. Since amounts is skimmed of the contract the user  no longer  ha s any way to protect  themselves from slippage
## Impact

`amountOutMin is useless to the user in Pair.swap(). If the `amountOutMin` is used for an intermediate operation but not to check the final amount, this can result in a loss of funds vulnerability for the user since they may receive fewer tokens than specified.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `amountOutMin` additionally in `Pair.swap()` when sending funds to the user
