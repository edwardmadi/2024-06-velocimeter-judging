## Summary
In GaugeV4 contract there is no check that shows if the contract is alive or not, By incorporating these checks, the contract can ensure that deposits are only accepted when it is in a proper operational state, thereby protecting users' assets and maintaining consistent state updates.

## Impact
The absence of the isAlive check in the depositFor and `_deposit` functions means that deposits can be made even if the contract is not in an active or operational state. This oversight can lead to issues.

Deposits could be accepted when the contract should be inactive, causing confusion and potentially leading to situations where funds are unintentionally locked or lost.

Without checking if the contract is alive, users might deposit tokens into a contract that has been paused or deactivated, risking the loss of their assets.

This might make the contract to process deposits in an unintended state, leading to inconsistent state updates or erroneous calculations related to rewards and balances.

## Code Snippet
```javascript
function depositFor(address account, uint amount) public lock {
    _deposit(account, amount, 0);
}
```
## POC
Consider a scenario where the depositFor function is called to deposit tokens into the contract:

```javascript
function depositFor(address account, uint amount) public lock {
    _deposit(account, amount, 0);
}
```

In the `_deposit` function:

```javascript
function _deposit(address account, uint amount, uint tokenId) private {
    require(amount > 0);
    _updateRewardForAllTokens();

    _safeTransferFrom(stake, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    totalSupply += amount;
    balanceOf[account] += amount;

    if (tokenId > 0) {
        require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).ownerOf(tokenId) == account);
        if (tokenIds[account] == 0) {
            tokenIds[account] = tokenId;
            IVoter(voter).attachTokenToGauge(tokenId, account);
        }
        require(tokenIds[account] == tokenId);
    } else {
        tokenId = tokenIds[account];
    }

    uint _derivedBalance = derivedBalances[account];
    derivedSupply -= _derivedBalance;
    _derivedBalance = derivedBalance(account);
    derivedBalances[account] = _derivedBalance;
    derivedSupply += _derivedBalance;

    _writeCheckpoint(account, _derivedBalance);
    _writeSupplyCheckpoint();

    IVoter(voter).emitDeposit(tokenId, account, amount);
    emit Deposit(account, tokenId, amount);
}
```

If the contract is not alive (e.g., it is paused or deactivated), the depositFor function should ideally prevent any deposits from being processed. Without the isAlive check, a user could call this function and deposit tokens even if the contract should not be accepting deposits.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, add the isAlive check in the `_deposit` function to ensure that deposits are only processed when the contract is active.

```javascript
require(IVoter(voter).isAlive(address(this)), "Contract is not alive");
```
