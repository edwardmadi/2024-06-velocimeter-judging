# Checkpointing total supply will be wrong if there hasn't been a checkpoint in `VotingEscrow` for a week

## Summary
Checkpointing total supply will be wrong if there hasn't been a checkpoint in `VotingEscrow` for a week

## Vulnerability Detail
When `RewardsDistributorV2.sol` wants to checkpoint the ve total supply, the way it does is by getting the latest point prior to the needed timestamp and use it's bias and slope to calculate the supply.

```solidity
                uint epoch = _find_timestamp_epoch(ve, t);
                IVotingEscrow.Point memory pt = IVotingEscrow(ve).point_history(epoch);
                int128 dt = 0;
                if (t > pt.ts) {
                    dt = int128(int256(t - pt.ts));
                }
                ve_supply[t] = Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt)), 0);
            }
```

The problem is that this does not account for slope changes. Every week (when locks expire) the slope is reduced. As this is not accounted for here, if there hasn't been a checkpoint in  `VotingEscrow` for over a week, this would result in lower supply recorded than supposed to. This would lead to overdistribution of rewards. In an extreme scenario it would result in recording a total supply of 0, which would cause DoS to the `RewardsDistributor` contract as any attempt to claim rewards will result in revert due to division by 0.

```solidity
                    to_distribute += balance_of * tokens_per_week[week_cursor] / ve_supply[week_cursor];
```


## Impact
Overdistribution of reawrds. DoS.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use VotingEscorw's `getPastTotalSupply` instead.
