# Burn Function is not a prerequisite in ERC20 token standard.

## Summary
In `OptionTokenV4.sol` the `expire` function makes use of the `burn` function, which might revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the `underlyingToken` in `OptionTokenV4.sol` does not implement the `burn` function,
when the admin calls the `expire` function, it will always revert.

## Impact
The contract `OptionTokenV4.sol` will not be able to burn the `underlyingToken` tokens as it was supposed to.

## Code Snippet
[calling burn on underlyingToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L546)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either handle the revertion gracefully and consider transferring the tokens to an unreachable address e.g. `0xdead`
Or validate that the `burn` function exists on the `underlyingToken` when deploying `OptionTokenV4.sol`
