# The _vote function does not apply maximum available voting power due to Solidity rounding down

## Summary
When voting, the algorithm that allocates weights to pools does not use up all available voting power for the token. This can disadvantage some voters, leading to skewed voting.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L249-L285

When voting, weights for each pool are allocated proportionally

```solidity
 uint256 _poolWeight = (_weights[i] * totalPower) / _totalVoteWeight;
```

This calculation leaves some amounts unallocated since Solidity will round down the calculation, making _ _totalWeight less than totalPower.
## Impact
Voters who will be affected by the rounding down might not be able to apply all available voting power compared to other voters who, for example, pass in single parameters. This might lead to skewed voting results, where a small difference determines the final result.
## Code Snippet
Minter.t.sol

```solidity
function testPoolWeight() public {
        initializeVotingEscrow();

        FLOW.approve(address(router), TOKEN_1);
        FRAX.approve(address(router), TOKEN_1);
        router.addLiquidity(
            address(FRAX),
            address(FLOW),
            false,
            TOKEN_1,
            TOKEN_1,
            0,
            0,
            address(owner),
            block.timestamp
        );
        address pair1 = router.pairFor(address(FRAX), address(FLOW), false);
        address pair2 = router.pairFor(address(DAI), address(FLOW), false);

        voter.createGauge(pair2, 0);

        _elapseOneWeek();

        uint256 maxPower = escrow.balanceOfNFT(1);
        console.log(maxPower);

        address[] memory pools = new address[](2);
        pools[0] = pair1;
        pools[1] = pair2;
        uint256[] memory weights = new uint256[](2);
        weights[0] = 1;
        weights[1] = 50;
        voter.vote(1, pools, weights);

        uint256 weightAlETH = voter.weights(pair1);
        uint256 weightSushi = voter.weights(pair2);
        assertGt(maxPower, weightSushi + weightAlETH);
    }

```
