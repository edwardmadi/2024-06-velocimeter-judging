# Inflated Voting Power Due to Duplicate veNFTs in Checkpoints

## Summary
The `_moveTokenDelegates` function in the Velocimeter contract is vulnerable to a voting power inflation attack. This vulnerability allows an attacker to artificially increase their voting power by exploiting the checkpoint creation mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` function, which determines whether to create a new checkpoint or use an existing one based on the timestamp. If multiple delegate moves occur within the same block (and thus, the same timestamp), the function will return the index of the last checkpoint instead of creating a new one.
This leads to the following issues:
* Duplicate veNFTs can be added to a single checkpoint.
* veNFTs may not be properly removed from the source delegate's checkpoint.
* The numCheckpoints can be incorrectly incremented.

Duplicate veNFTs can be added to a single checkpoint.
veNFTs may not be properly removed from the source delegate's checkpoint.
The numCheckpoints can be incorrectly incremented.

Let's consider a scenario with two users, Alice and Bob, and two veNFTs (tokenId 1 and 2).
Initial state:
* Alice owns tokenId 1 and 2
* Alice has delegated her voting power to herself
* Bob has no veNFTs and no voting power
Step 1: Bob convinces Alice to transfer tokenId 1 to him.
Alice calls `transferFrom(alice, bob, 1)`, which triggers `_moveTokenDelegates(alice, bob, 1)`.
After this operation:
* Alice's checkpoint: [2]
* Bob's checkpoint: [1]
Step 2: Within the same block, Bob convinces Alice to transfer tokenId 2 to him.
Alice calls `transferFrom(alice, bob, 2)`, which triggers `_moveTokenDelegates(alice, bob, 2)`.
Due to the vulnerability, instead of creating a new checkpoint, the function updates the existing checkpoint:
* Alice's checkpoint: [2] (tokenId 2 wasn't removed due to the bug)
* Bob's checkpoint: [1, 1, 2] (tokenId 1 is duplicated, and 2 is added)
Step 3: Bob transfers tokenId 1 back to Alice in the next block.
Bob calls `transferFrom(bob, alice, 1)`, which triggers `_moveTokenDelegates(bob, alice, 1)`.
After:
* Alice's checkpoint: [2, 1]
* Bob's checkpoint: [1, 2] (only one instance of tokenId 1 is removed)
Final state:
* Alice owns tokenId 1 and has voting power for 2 veNFTs
* Bob owns tokenId 2 but has voting power for 2 veNFTs
In this scenario, Bob has successfully inflated his voting power. Despite only owning one veNFT, he has voting power equivalent to two veNFTs. This inflated voting power could allow Bob to:
1. Have disproportionate influence in governance decisions
2. Receive more rewards than he should in systems where rewards are distributed based on voting power
3. Manipulate gauge weights to direct more rewards to pools he's invested in
Meanwhile, Alice's voting power remains the same as if she had two veNFTs, even though she now only owns one. This could lead to:
1. Dilution of her actual voting power in governance decisions
2. Receiving fewer rewards than she should in reward distribution systems
3. Less influence over gauge weights than she should have
This attack could be repeated multiple times within the same block to further inflate Bob's voting power, potentially leading to significant imbalances in the protocol's governance and reward systems.

## Impact
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:

* Artificially inflate their voting power by having the same veNFT counted multiple times.
* Manipulate governance decisions and gauge weight voting.
* Potentially redirect rewards to gauges where they have a vested interest, causing loss of assets or rewards for other users.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1534-L1583

```solidity
function _findWhatCheckpointToWrite(address account)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint32)
{
    uint _timestamp = block.timestamp;
    uint32 _nCheckPoints = numCheckpoints[account];

    if (
        _nCheckPoints > 0 &&
        checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].timestamp == _timestamp
    ) {
        return _nCheckPoints - 1;
    } else {
        return _nCheckPoints;
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the move token delegate logic within the affected functions (VotingEscrow._moveTokenDelegates and VotingEscrow._moveAllDelegates) to ensure that the latest checkpoint is overwritten correctly when the functions are triggered more than once within a single block.
Ensure that the following invariants hold in the new code:

No duplicated veNFTs (tokenIDs) within a checkpoint
* When moving a tokenID, it must be deleted from the source tokenIds list and added to the destination tokenIds list
* No more than one checkpoint within the same block for an account. Otherwise, the binary search within the * 
*  VotingEscrow.getPastVotesIndex will return an incorrect number of votes
Additionally, address the issue with the fromBlock (or in this case, timestamp) of a checkpoint:
* Ensure that the timestamp of a checkpoint is properly set and used in the _findWhatCheckpointToWrite function.
