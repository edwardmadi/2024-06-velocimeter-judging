# Malicious users can inflate voting power through duplicate veNFTs in `VotingEscrow::_moveTokenDelegates()`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`VotingEscrow` contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol) implements a voting mechanism where users can delegate their voting power represented by `veNFTs` to other addresses. The contract uses a checkpoint system to track the voting power of each address over time. 

The [`_moveTokenDelegates()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1362-L1411) function is responsible for updating these checkpoints when `veNFTs` are transferred between addresses. It relies on the [`_findWhatCheckpointToWrite()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1413-L1429) function to determine which checkpoint should be updated. However, there's a critical flaw in this logic that can lead to vote inflation.

The `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite()` function returns the index of the last checkpoint if it was created in the same block as the current transaction. This is intended to allow multiple updates to be consolidated into a single checkpoint. However, the `_moveTokenDelegates()` function doesn't handle this case correctly. It always increments the `numCheckpoints` counter and adds the transferred `veNFT` to the destination's checkpoint, even if it's updating an existing checkpoint.
```solidity
//......
numCheckpoints[srcRep] = srcRepNum + 1;
//......
numCheckpoints[dstRep] = dstRepNum + 1;
//......
```


This creates a vulnerability where a malicious user can inflate their voting power by repeatedly transferring the same `veNFT` back and forth within a single block. Each transfer will add the `veNFT` to the destination's checkpoint without properly removing it from the source's checkpoint, effectively duplicating the voting power.

The highest impact scenario would be a large `veNFT` holder exploiting this vulnerability to gain disproportionate control over governance decisions or to manipulate reward distributions in systems that rely on this voting mechanism.

## Impact
This vulnerability allows malicious users to artificially inflate their voting power, potentially by orders of magnitude. This can lead to severe manipulation of governance decisions, unfair distribution of rewards in gauge voting systems, and a complete undermining of the protocol's democratic processes. The integrity of any system relying on this voting mechanism is compromised, potentially leading to loss of funds or control for other users and stakeholders.

## Proof of Concept
1. Alice owns veNFT with ID 1, which represents 100 votes.
2. Alice transfers veNFT 1 to Bob using `transferFrom()`.
   - Internally, this calls `_moveTokenDelegates(Alice, Bob, 1)`.
   - A new checkpoint is created for Bob with veNFT 1.
3. Bob immediately transfers veNFT 1 back to Alice in the same block.
   - This calls `_moveTokenDelegates(Bob, Alice, 1)`.
   - Due to `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite()`, the same checkpoint is used.
   - veNFT 1 is added to Alice's checkpoint without being removed from Bob's.
4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated multiple times within the same block.
5. At the end of the block, both Alice and Bob have multiple entries of veNFT 1 in their checkpoints, each representing 100 votes.
6. When `getVotes()` is called for Alice or Bob, it sums up all entries in the latest checkpoint, resulting in inflated voting power.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, the `_moveTokenDelegates()` function should be updated to properly handle cases where it's updating an existing checkpoint. Here's a suggested fix:

```diff
function _moveTokenDelegates(
    address srcRep,
    address dstRep,
    uint _tokenId
) internal {
    if (srcRep != dstRep && _tokenId > 0) {
        if (srcRep != address(0)) {
            uint32 srcRepNum = numCheckpoints[srcRep];
            uint[] storage srcRepOld = srcRepNum > 0
                ? checkpoints[srcRep][srcRepNum - 1].tokenIds
                : checkpoints[srcRep][0].tokenIds;
            uint32 nextSrcRepNum = _findWhatCheckpointToWrite(srcRep);
            uint[] storage srcRepNew = checkpoints[srcRep][nextSrcRepNum].tokenIds;
            // All the same except _tokenId
            for (uint i = 0; i < srcRepOld.length; i++) {
                uint tId = srcRepOld[i];
                if (tId != _tokenId) {
                    srcRepNew.push(tId);
                }
            }
-           numCheckpoints[srcRep] = srcRepNum + 1;
+           if (nextSrcRepNum == srcRepNum) {
+               numCheckpoints[srcRep] = srcRepNum + 1;
+           }
        }

        if (dstRep != address(0)) {
            uint32 dstRepNum = numCheckpoints[dstRep];
            uint[] storage dstRepOld = dstRepNum > 0
                ? checkpoints[dstRep][dstRepNum - 1].tokenIds
                : checkpoints[dstRep][0].tokenIds;
            uint32 nextDstRepNum = _findWhatCheckpointToWrite(dstRep);
            uint[] storage dstRepNew = checkpoints[dstRep][nextDstRepNum].tokenIds;
            // All the same plus _tokenId
            require(
                dstRepOld.length + 1 <= MAX_DELEGATES,
                "dstRep would have too many tokenIds"
            );
+           bool tokenAlreadyExists = false;
            for (uint i = 0; i < dstRepOld.length; i++) {
                uint tId = dstRepOld[i];
                dstRepNew.push(tId);
+               if (tId == _tokenId) {
+                   tokenAlreadyExists = true;
+               }
            }
-           dstRepNew.push(_tokenId);
+           if (!tokenAlreadyExists) {
+               dstRepNew.push(_tokenId);
+           }

-           numCheckpoints[dstRep] = dstRepNum + 1;
+           if (nextDstRepNum == dstRepNum) {
+               numCheckpoints[dstRep] = dstRepNum + 1;
+           }
        }
    }
}
```

This fix ensures that `numCheckpoints` is only incremented when a new checkpoint is actually created, and prevents duplicate entries of the same veNFT within a single checkpoint. Additionally, it checks if the token already exists in the destination's checkpoint before adding it, further preventing duplication.
