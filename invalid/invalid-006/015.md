# VotingEscrow::_moveTokenDelegates can lead to double tokenIds being present in checkpoints when a user is transfered 2 tokens within the same block

## Summary

`VotingEscrow::_moveTokenDelegates` and `VotingEscrow::__moveAllDelegates` utilise `VotingEscrow::_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` to determine what array to write the new tokenIds to during a tokenId transfer. There is a flaw in the code that can lead to duplicate tokenIds being written to a checkpoint's tokenId if a user is transfered two tokens within the same block.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a token is being moved from user A to user B, the user A's delegates from the token that is being transfered need to be moved to user B. This process involves itterating through all of user A's delegations and moving any delegations that are from the token that is being moved to user B's delegation list. 

The process works correctly as long as a new array is used during the process, the array that is utilised for moving the delegations is retrieved from `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` where it will returns index of a new checkpoint, and the process works correctly.

However a scenario can occur if an account is transfered two tokens within the same block, as the index of a non-empty checkpoint will be returned which will lead to duplicate tokens being present in the checkpoint.

```solidity
    function _findWhatCheckpointToWrite(address account)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint32)
    {
        uint _timestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint32 _nCheckPoints = numCheckpoints[account];

>       if ( _nCheckPoints > 0 &&
>           checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].timestamp == _timestamp
>       ) {
            return _nCheckPoints - 1;
        } else {
            return _nCheckPoints;
        }
    }
```
The condition to return the index of a non-empty checkpoint array is that the latest checkpoint was conducted at the current timestamp. The timestamp will be the same for all transactions within one block, meaning any subsequence NFT transfers after the first transfer that occur to a user within the same block will trigger this scenario.

POC run through:
Assume at the start of the block:
numCheckpoints[UserA] = 1
checkpoints[UserA][0].tokenIds = [tokenId1, tokenId2]

numCheckpoints[UserB] = 1
checkpoints[UserB][0].tokenIds = [tokenId3]

Then UserA transfers tokenId1 to UserB:

After first transfer:
numCheckpoints[UserA] = 2
checkpoints[UserA][0].tokenIds = [tokenId1, tokenId2]
checkpoints[UserA][1].tokenIds = [tokenId2]

numCheckpoints[UserB] = 2
checkpoints[UserB][0].tokenIds = [tokenId3]

So far so good, now lets transfer tokenId2 from UserA to UserB within the same block (same timestamp):

Note: The same issue was reported to Velodrome (from which this code is 1-to-1) by [SpearBit in July 17, 2023](https://solodit.xyz/issues/inflated-voting-balance-due-to-duplicated-venfts-within-a-checkpoint-spearbit-none-velodrome-finance-pdf).

Note2: The `VotingEscrow.sol` contract currently has a different bug (which is outlined in a seperate report) that leads to the contract not initialising Checkpoint timestamps, meaning they will always be equal to `0`. This means that currently this issue cannot occur, however the code logic within `VotingEscrow::_moveTokenDelegates` and `VotingEscrow::_findWhatCheckpointToWrite()` is incorrect and once the Checkpoint timestamp initialisation issue is resolved, this bug will surface and therefore this needs to also be fixed.

## Impact

When one account receives two tokens within the same block/ timestamp, the logic within `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite()` will return `_nCheckPoints - 1` which will cause:
1. From account will still contains the tokenId that was transfered
2. To account will contains duplicate tokenIds.

This duplication of tokenIds will lead to voting power being incorrectly inflated for the checkpoint (checkpoints[UserB][1] in the POC), which can be abused to increase the accounts voting power, which can lead to a loss of funds if the voting power is used to vote for gauges where the user can profit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To ensure that checkpoint tokenIds cannot contain duplicate tokenIds:
1. When moving a tokenId from src to dst, ensure that it is deleted from the src list.
2. Ensure that only one checkpoint is made for each account per block.
3. Ensure a checkpoint does not contain duplicate tokenIds (can add a sanity check as a safety precaution and revert if the new checkpoint contain duplicate tokenIds after the transfer).

There is a mitigation provided in the linked audit report where this same issue was found by spearbit for an understanding of how the fixed implementation logic could look like.
