# Inflated voting balance due to duplicated veBVM within a checkpoint


## Summary
The `_moveTokenDelegates` and `_moveAllDelegates` functions can cause an inflated voting balance due to duplicated `veBVMs` (tokenIDs) within a checkpoint under certain circumstances. This issue arises because a checkpoint may contain duplicated `veBVMs`, leading to double-counting of voting balances.

## Vulnerability Detail
Malicious users can exploit this vulnerability to inflate their voting balance and participate in gauge weight voting, potentially causing loss of assets or rewards for other users if the inflated voting balance is used maliciously (e.g., redirecting rewards to gauges where attackers have a vested interest).

The issue stems from the existing `_moveTokenDelegates` function, which relies on the `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` function to return the index of a new checkpoint. However, the `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` function does not always return the index of a new checkpoint; it returns the last checkpoint if it has already been written within the same block. If `_moveTokenDelegates` is triggered more than once within the same block (e.g., performing NFT transfer twice to the same person), the first transfer will return a new checkpoint, but the second transfer will return the last/previous checkpoint, causing the move token delegate logic to be incorrect during the second transfer.

## Impact
This issue can result in an inflated voting balance due to duplicated `veBVMs` within a checkpoint, allowing malicious users to manipulate gauge weight voting, potentially causing loss of assets or rewards for other users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the move token delegate logic within the affected functions (`_moveTokenDelegates` and `_moveAllDelegates`) to ensure that the latest checkpoint is correctly overwritten when the functions are triggered more than once within a single block. Additionally, ensure that the following invariants are maintained:

- No duplicated `veBVMs` (tokenIDs) within a checkpoint.
- When moving a tokenID, it must be deleted from the source tokenIds list and added to the destination tokenIds list.
- No more than one checkpoint within the same block for an account, as the binary search within the `getPastVotesIndex` will return an incorrect number of votes otherwise.
