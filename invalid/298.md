# Incorrect calculation of TWAP in `OptionTokenV4.getTimeWeightedAveragePrice()` function.

## Summary

The average price returned by `OptionTokenV4.getTimeWeightedAveragePrice()` can be up to 30 minutes outdated and does not reflect the current Token price.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `getTimeWeightedAveragePrice()` function, the average price is calculated using the last `X` known price observations from the `Pair` contract. However, this approach has a flaw because it does not consider the current price, which could be as much as 30 minutes old.

Consider a scenario where the price of the Token significantly increases during this 30-minute window. The resulting maximum discount might not adequately cover the percentage increase in price. This could lead to the protocol failing to collect proper fees when exercising the Tokens.

## Impact

The use of an outdated TWAP price could result in losses for the protocol or users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, incorporating also the current price retrieved from `Pair.current()` function:

```diff
function getTimeWeightedAveragePrice(uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256[] memory amtsOut = IPair(pair).prices(
        underlyingToken,
        _amount,
        twapPoints
    );
    uint256 len = amtsOut.length;
    uint256 summedAmount;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        summedAmount += amtsOut[i];
    }

+    summedAmount += IPair(pair).current(underlyingToken, _amount);

-    return summedAmount / twapPoints;
+    return (summedAmount / twapPoints) + 1;
}
```
