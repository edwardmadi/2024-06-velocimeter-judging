# Some weird ERC20 tokens are not compatible with the `Pair` contract approve functionality

## Summary
There are some weird ERC20 tokens with the following approve functionality:
>Some tokens (e.g. UNI, COMP) revert if the value passed to approve or transfer is larger than uint96.

Such tokens are incompatible with the `Pair` contract, which shouldn't be the case as described in the `README.md`
## Vulnerability Detail
Since the `Pair` contract uses `type(uint256).max` as approve value for the bribes, tokens with such functionality a fully incompatible with the bribes
## Impact
Such tokens can't be used in the `Pair` contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set the approve value to `type(uint96).max` like this:
```diff
    function setExternalBribe(address _externalBribe) external {
        require(msg.sender == voter, "Only voter can set external bribe");
        externalBribe = _externalBribe;
-        _safeApprove(token0, externalBribe, type(uint).max);
-        _safeApprove(token1, externalBribe, type(uint).max);
+       _safeApprove(token0, externalBribe, type(uint).max);
+       _safeApprove(token1, externalBribe, type(uint).max);
        emit ExternalBribeSet(_externalBribe);
    }
```
