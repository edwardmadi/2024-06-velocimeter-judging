# Token Detachment in GaugeV4's withdrawToken Function with 0 amount

## Summary
The withdrawToken function in the GaugeV4 contract allows users to detach their token from the gauge even when withdrawing 0 amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the withdrawToken function, the token detachment logic is not properly guarded against zero-amount withdrawals. An attacker can exploit this by calling the function with an amount of 0 and a valid tokenId, causing the token to be detached from the gauge without actually withdrawing any stake.

## Impact
This can lead to inconsistencies between the actual staked amount and the voting power associated with the gauge.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the withdrawToken function to only detach the token if the withdrawal amount is greater than 0. Here's the suggested fix:
```solidity
function withdrawToken(uint amount, uint tokenId) public lock {
    require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw 0 amount");
    // ... (previous code)

    if (tokenId > 0 && amount > 0) {
        require(tokenId == tokenIds[msg.sender]);
        tokenIds[msg.sender] = 0;
        IVoter(voter).detachTokenFromGauge(tokenId, msg.sender);
    } else {
        tokenId = tokenIds[msg.sender];
    }

    // ... (rest of the function)
}
```
