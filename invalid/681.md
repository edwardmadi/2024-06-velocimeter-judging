# critical missed check in the `expire()` function:


## Vulnerability Detail

in the `expire()` function:

```solidity
function expire() external onlyAdmin {
    require(expiryTime != 0,"expiry not started");
    require(expiryTime < block.timestamp,"no expiry time");

    IERC20(underlyingToken).burn(IERC20(underlyingToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
}
```

The bug is that this function burns all the underlying tokens held by the contract without checking if there are still outstanding option tokens. This could lead to a situation where users still hold option tokens, but the underlying tokens have been burned, making it impossible for them to exercise their options.

To solve this , we should add a check to ensure that all option tokens have been burned or exercised before allowing the underlying tokens to be burned. Here's a suggested fix:

```solidity
function expire() external onlyAdmin {
    require(expiryTime != 0, "expiry not started");
    require(expiryTime < block.timestamp, "no expiry time");
    require(totalSupply == 0, "outstanding options exist");

    IERC20(underlyingToken).burn(IERC20(underlyingToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
}
```

By adding the `require(totalSupply == 0, "outstanding options exist");` check, you ensure that all option tokens have been burned or exercised before allowing the underlying tokens to be burned. This protects option token holders from losing their ability to exercise their options due to premature burning of the underlying tokens.
