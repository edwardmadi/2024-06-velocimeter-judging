# All users that set maxlock will not be able to withdraw

## Summary
All users that set maxlock will not be able to withdraw any of their funds .

## Vulnerability Detail
in `votingescrow.sol` the protocol allows users lock their for funds for max lock time(52 weeks) with a special set of functions, the issue is that i think there was a copy paste mistake during code writing that caused `max_lock()`  to be pasted under `_isApprovedOrOwner()`
`  function _isApprovedOrOwner(address _spender, uint _tokenId) internal returns (bool) {
 @@ > max_lock(_tokenId);` .
So when a user tries withdraw  after 52 weeks, 
` function withdraw(uint _tokenId) external nonreentrant {
        assert(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));`  `_isApprovedOrOwner()` is invoked which calls `max_lock()` .

 ` function max_lock(uint _tokenId) public {
        if(maxLockIdToIndex[_tokenId] !=0 && max_lock_enabled) {
            LockedBalance memory _locked = locked[_tokenId];
            uint unlock_time = (block.timestamp + MAXTIME) / WEEK * WEEK; // Locktime is rounded down to weeks
             if(unlock_time > _locked.end) {
    @@>>    require(_locked.end > block.timestamp, 'Lock expired'); ` 

this require statment is invoked which causes it to permanently DOS.

## Impact
All users that staked with max lock will permanently lose their funds

## Recommendation
Remove the `max_lock()` function from inside the apporovedor owner function
