# Any user can unintentionally extend lock time to maximum, affecting token owners (`VotingEscrow::_isApprovedOrOwner`)

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `VotingEscrow` contract implements a system where users can lock their tokens for a certain period to gain voting power. The contract includes functionality to manage these locks, including the ability to extend lock times. The [`_isApprovedOrOwner()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L295-L307) is a crucial part of this system, designed to check if a given address has the authority to perform actions on a specific token.

However, the current implementation of `_isApprovedOrOwner()` contains a critical flaw. It calls the `max_lock()` function, which can potentially extend the lock time of a token to the maximum allowed period. This occurs if the `max_lock_enabled` flag is set and the token ID is in the `max_locked_nfts` list.

The issue arises because `_isApprovedOrOwner()` is called by numerous other functions in the contract, including `approve()`, `transferFrom()`, `safeTransferFrom()`, `increase_amount()`, `withdraw()`, and others. As a result, any interaction with these functions could inadvertently trigger a lock extension, even when that's not the user's intention.

The root cause of this issue is in the `_isApprovedOrOwner()` function:

```solidity
function _isApprovedOrOwner(address _spender, uint _tokenId) internal returns (bool) {
    max_lock(_tokenId); // This line causes the unintended lock extension
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

This implementation violates the principle of least surprise and could lead to significant issues for users of the contract.

## Impact

The impact of this bug is severe. Token owners lose control over their lock times, as any interaction with their tokens could potentially extend the lock to the maximum period. This could prevent users from withdrawing their tokens when intended, leading to financial losses or missed opportunities. 

Moreover, the increased gas costs due to unnecessary state changes in what should be read-only operations could make the contract more expensive to interact with. This could deter users from using the contract or lead to unexpected transaction costs.

The bug also opens up possibilities for malicious exploitation. An attacker could force other users' tokens to remain locked for longer than intended, potentially manipulating voting power distribution or preventing token withdrawals at crucial times.

## Proof of Concept

1. Alice creates a lock for her tokens for 1 week using `create_lock()`.
2. Bob, an unrelated user, calls `isApprovedOrOwner()` to check if he has permission for Alice's token (he doesn't).
3. Despite Bob not having any permissions, Alice's lock is extended to the maximum period (52 weeks) due to the `max_lock()` call in `_isApprovedOrOwner()`.
4. Alice tries to withdraw her tokens after the original 1-week period, but finds she can't because the lock has been extended without her knowledge or consent.

## Recommendation

Remove the `max_lock()` call from the `_isApprovedOrOwner()` function and make it a view function. Here's the recommended change:

```diff
function _isApprovedOrOwner(address _spender, uint _tokenId) internal view returns (bool) {
-   max_lock(_tokenId);
    address tokenOwner = idToOwner[_tokenId];
    bool spenderIsOwner = tokenOwner == _spender;
    bool spenderIsApproved = _spender == idToApprovals[_tokenId];
    bool spenderIsApprovedForAll = (ownerToOperators[tokenOwner])[_spender];
    return spenderIsOwner || spenderIsApproved || spenderIsApprovedForAll;
}
```

This change ensures that `_isApprovedOrOwner()` performs only its intended function of checking permissions without any side effects..
