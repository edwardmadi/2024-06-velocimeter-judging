# The `_isApprovedOrOwner()` function calls `max_lock()` by mistake and thus DoS the entire protocol

## Summary

The `_isApprovedOrOwner()` function calls `max_lock()` by mistake and thus DoS the entire protocol. 
## Vulnerability Detail

The `_isApprovedOrOwner()` function in `VotingEscrow.sol` check whether a given address (`_spender`) is permitted to transfer a specific token (`_tokenId`). This check can be based on direct ownership, specific approval for the token, or approval for all tokens owned by the owner:

```solidity
    function _isApprovedOrOwner(address _spender, uint _tokenId) internal returns (bool) {
        max_lock(_tokenId);

        address tokenOwner = idToOwner[_tokenId];
        bool spenderIsOwner = tokenOwner == _spender;
        bool spenderIsApproved = _spender == idToApprovals[_tokenId];
        bool spenderIsApprovedForAll = (ownerToOperators[tokenOwner])[_spender];
        return spenderIsOwner || spenderIsApproved || spenderIsApprovedForAll;
    }
```

This is a very important function and is called as a check in many functions in the contract: 
- `_transferFrom()`
- `_burn()` 
- `increase_amount()`
- `enable_max_lock()`
- `disable_max_lock()`
- `increase_unlock_time()`
- `withdraw()`
- `merge()`
- `split()`

The bug here is that `_isApprovedOrOwner()` always calls the `max_lock()` function. This means that whenever any of the above functions are called, they will also call the `max_lock()` function. 
## Impact

The protocol becomes unusable because every time a function of the above is called, it will call `max_lock()`. There are other checks in `max_lock()` that will make the functions revert almost every time. This means the DoS of the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the `max_lock(_tokenId)` call from the `_isApprovedOrOwner` function to ensure it only performs the intended permission checks without modifying the state or causing potential reverts.
