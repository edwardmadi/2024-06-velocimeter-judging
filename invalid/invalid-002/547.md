# Anyone can prolong all maxlock users locktime

## Summary
Anyone can prolong max users lock time because of lack of access control/modifier

## Vulnerability Detail
In `votingescrow.sol`, users can lock their tokens for a given max lock time (52 weeks) the vulnerability is found in `max_lock_bulk()` where there is a lack of access control on who can call the function, so anybody can call that function and this then calls `max_lock()` which then extends the locktime of all tokens that were locked for the max time by another max time and all the caller spends is gas fees and the person can come back after 51 weeks and call this again prolonging it by another 52 weeks locking all max lock users funds in the contract because `locked.end` will never be reached. All relevant code snippets will be posted below

## Impact
All users that used max lock will never be able to withdraw.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an access control that was implemented in `withdraw()`, `increaselocktime()` etc.
