# A malicious user can increase an honest user's NFT lock time to infinity

## Summary

A malicious user can increase an honest user's NFT lock time to infinity. This can happen because the `max_lock()` function has no access control.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `VotingEscrow.sol`, we have `max_lock()` function. 

```solidity
    function max_lock(uint _tokenId) public { 
        if(maxLockIdToIndex[_tokenId] !=0 && max_lock_enabled) {
            LockedBalance memory _locked = locked[_tokenId];
            uint unlock_time = (block.timestamp + MAXTIME) / WEEK * WEEK; // Locktime is rounded down to weeks

            if(unlock_time > _locked.end) {
                require(_locked.end > block.timestamp, 'Lock expired');
                require(_locked.amount > 0, 'Nothing is locked');
                require(unlock_time <= block.timestamp + MAXTIME, 'Voting lock can be 52 weeks max');

                _deposit_for(_tokenId, 0, unlock_time, _locked, DepositType.INCREASE_UNLOCK_TIME);
            }
        }
    }
```
This function extends the unlock time of NFTs to the maximum lock time. 

The vulnerability here is the `max_lock()` function does not have access control, meaning anyone can call it to extend the lock time of any NFT in the `maxLockIdToIndex`. 

We can see that `deposit_for()`  even has a warning in NatSpec:

> Anyone (even a smart contract) can deposit for someone else, but cannot extend their locktime.

`max_lock()` is no access control, and any user who wants to can lock another user's tokens for a year and call the function constantly, effectively locking out NFT forever.
## Impact

If access control is not added, any user can potentially lock NFTs for the maximum period without the owner's consent. This can be made even easier by calling just one function, `max_lock_bulk()`, which will iterate through all the tokens of all the users and lock them.

## Recommendation

Add access control in the `max_lock()` function.
