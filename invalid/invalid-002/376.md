# veNFT's max lock is still enabled after transfer

## Summary
A veNFT with max lock enabled is transferrable, allowing anybody to max lock the funds of the new user right after the transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `max_lock` is enabled for a veNFT, anybody is able to call `max_lock` to lock the funds for the max duration:

Before a veNFT is transferable, the contract checks whether all the approvals are void, it isn't attached to any gauge and so on. But, it doesn't check whether max_lock was disabled:

This enables the following attack vector:

1. Alice has a veNFT with funds locked for another week with `max_lock` enabled.
2. Alice needs to access her funds so she decides to sell her veNFT
3. Bob buys it for a discount, e.g. 90%, expecting to access the underlying funds in a week
4. Right after the transfer, Alice or anybody else, calls `max_lock()` to lock Bob's veNFT for the max duration, a year.

Bob is left with funds locked for 1 year instead of just 1 week.

## Impact
Unexpected lock duration for new owners of veNFTs.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
max_lock should be cleared before the transfer. The new owner should have to re-enable it if they want.
