# Addition overflow of reserveCumulative would completely brick the overall contract

## Summary
reserveCumulative would revert when it overflows

## Vulnerability Detail
Because the Solidity version used by the current implementation of `Pair.sol` is ^0.8.0, and there are some breaking changes in Solidity v0.8.0:
> Arithmetic operations revert on underflow and overflow.

[Pair.sol#currentcumulativePrices](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Pair.sol#L182) is identical implementation of [UniswapV2OracleLibrary#currentCumulativePrices](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/libraries/UniswapV2OracleLibrary.sol#L25-L33)
While in UniswapV2OracleLibrary.sol, subtraction overflow is desired at blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast in currentCumulativePrices() cause the solidity version used is `>=0.5.0`
```solidity
if (blockTimestampLast != blockTimestamp) {
            // subtraction overflow is desired
            uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast;
            // addition overflow is desired
            // counterfactual
            price0Cumulative += uint(FixedPoint.fraction(reserve1, reserve0)._x) * timeElapsed;
            // counterfactual
            price1Cumulative += uint(FixedPoint.fraction(reserve0, reserve1)._x) * timeElapsed;
        }
```
In another word, Uniswap/v2-periphery/contracts/libraries/UniswapV2OracleLibrary only works at solidity < 0.8.0.

As a result, when reserve0Cumulative or reserve1Cumulative is big enough, [currentCumulativePrices()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Pair.sol#L189C8-L194C10) will revert due to overflow.

Another instance of same issue in [_update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Pair.sol#L164C9-L168C10)

## Impact
Since the overflow is desired in the original version, and it's broken because of using Solidity version >0.8. The `currentCumulativePrices` and `_update` will break when the desired overflow happens, and further breaks other critical parts of the system that relies on the function.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
  function currentCumulativePrices() public view returns (uint reserve0Cumulative, uint reserve1Cumulative, uint blockTimestamp) {
        blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        reserve0Cumulative = reserve0CumulativeLast;
        reserve1Cumulative = reserve1CumulativeLast;
+ unchecked {
        // if time has elapsed since the last update on the pair, mock the accumulated price values
        (uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1, uint _blockTimestampLast) = getReserves();
        if (_blockTimestampLast != blockTimestamp) {
            // subtraction overflow is desired
            uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _blockTimestampLast;
            reserve0Cumulative += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
            reserve1Cumulative += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
        }
+ }
    }

```
```diff
function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) internal {
        uint blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
+ unchecked {
        uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
            reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
            reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
        }
+ }
        Observation memory _point = lastObservation();
        timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _point.timestamp; // compare the last observation with current timestamp, if greater than 30 minutes, record a new event
        if (timeElapsed > periodSize) {
            observations.push(Observation(blockTimestamp, reserve0CumulativeLast, reserve1CumulativeLast));
        }
        reserve0 = balance0;
        reserve1 = balance1;
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }
