# _update() increments reserve0CumulativeLast and reserve1CumulativeLast will revert and break all contract functionality.

## Summary
 _update() increments reserve0CumulativeLast and reserve1CumulativeLast which are ever-increasing variables. At some point this will overflow, always revert and break all contract functionality.
## Vulnerability Detail
Because the solidity version used by the current implementation is 0.8.13, and there are some breaking changes in Solidity v0.8.0: thus uniswap v2 contracts without major modification works under < v0.8.0 solidity version 

Arithmetic operations revert on underflow and overflow.

Ref: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/080-breaking-changes.html#silent-changes-of-the-semantics

so the places where overflow-underflow made possible by uniswap and is `Desired` may revert due to underflow/overflow.
## Impact

`_update()` function and `currentCumulativePrices()` may revert cause solidity version will do it, and uniswap original version uses solidity version v0.5.6 and thus their contracts works fine but in here it will revert and the whole functionalities which rely on `_update()` or `currentCumulativePrices()` or `current` will revert as well.

```solidity 
 function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) internal {
        uint blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
            reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
            reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
        }

        Observation memory _point = lastObservation();
        timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _point.timestamp; // compare the last observation with current timestamp, if greater than 30 minutes, record a new event
        if (timeElapsed > periodSize) {
            observations.push(Observation(blockTimestamp, reserve0CumulativeLast, reserve1CumulativeLast));
        }
        reserve0 = balance0;
        reserve1 = balance1;
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }

    // produces the cumulative price using counterfactuals to save gas and avoid a call to sync.
    function currentCumulativePrices() public view returns (uint reserve0Cumulative, uint reserve1Cumulative, uint blockTimestamp) {
        blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        reserve0Cumulative = reserve0CumulativeLast;
        reserve1Cumulative = reserve1CumulativeLast;

        // if time has elapsed since the last update on the pair, mock the accumulated price values
        (uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1, uint _blockTimestampLast) = getReserves();
        if (_blockTimestampLast != blockTimestamp) {
            // subtraction overflow is desired
            uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _blockTimestampLast;
            reserve0Cumulative += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
            reserve1Cumulative += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
        }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- consider adding those desired overflow/underflow operations into `unchecked` 

```diff

 uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
+            unchecked{
            reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
            reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
+            }
        }
```
