# Pair potential permanent DoS due to overflow

## Summary
The pair contract in the protocol is forked from Uniswap V2, which was developed using Solidity 0.6.6 where arithmetic operations can overflow and underflow by default. However, the _update() function in the protocol does not handle overflow cases properly, which could lead to a permanent denial of service (DoS).

## Vulnerability Detail
In the Pair._update() function, overflow is intentionally desired in the calculations for timeElapsed and CumulativeLast. 
```solidity
    // update reserves and, on the first call per block, price accumulators
    function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) internal {
        uint blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
            reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
            reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
        }

        Observation memory _point = lastObservation();
        timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _point.timestamp; // compare the last observation with current timestamp, if greater than 30 minutes, record a new event
        if (timeElapsed > periodSize) {
            observations.push(Observation(blockTimestamp, reserve0CumulativeLast, reserve1CumulativeLast));
        }
        reserve0 = balance0;
        reserve1 = balance1;
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }

```

This is forked from the UniswapV2 source code, and itâ€™s meant and known to overflow. UniswapV2 was developed using Solidity 0.6.6, where arithmetic operations overflow and underflow by default. However, the protocol utilizes Solidity >=0.8.0, where such operations will automatically revert.
```solidity
 // update reserves and, on the first call per block, price accumulators
    function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1) private {
        require(balance0 <= uint112(-1) && balance1 <= uint112(-1), 'UniswapV2: OVERFLOW');
        uint32 blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp % 2**32);
        uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
            // * never overflows, and + overflow is desired
            price0CumulativeLast += uint(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve1).uqdiv(_reserve0)) * timeElapsed;
            price1CumulativeLast += uint(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve0).uqdiv(_reserve1)) * timeElapsed;
        }
        reserve0 = uint112(balance0);
        reserve1 = uint112(balance1);
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }
```

## Impact
This issue could potentially lead to permanent denial of service for a pool. All the core functionalities such as mint, burn, or swap would be broken. Consequently, all funds would be locked within the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the unchecked block to ensure everything overflows as expected.
