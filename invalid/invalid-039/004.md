# SafeMath potential underflow in Pair.sol -- (comments says underflow is desired)

## Summary
SafeMath statement potential underflow, which contradicts the comment that states that "underflow is desired".

## Vulnerability Detail
The codebase is a modification of a Uniswap V2 fork, which was written in solidity 0.7.x, which does not have SafeMath enabled by default. The `timeElapsed` local variable (and the cumulativeLast variables) in [Uniswap V2 codebase](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L76-L81) is supposed to handle math underflow. 

## Impact
When sufficient time passed, the pair will no longer be functional, due to subtraction underflow in these variables, and since the pair is not upgradeable, it will not be functional forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Use unchecked math for these steps, to comply with the original Uniswap V2's underflow desire
