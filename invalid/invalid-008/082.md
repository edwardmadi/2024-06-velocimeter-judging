# Incorrect DOMAIN_TYPEHASH Implementation Breaks EIP-712 Compatibility

## Summary
The DOMAIN_TYPEHASH in the VotingEscrow contract is incorrectly implemented, omitting the version field required by EIP-712. This mismatch causes the delegateBySig function to fail, breaking signature-based delegation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract defines DOMAIN_TYPEHASH as:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1259

However, in the delegateBySig function, it builds the domainSeparator including the version:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1515-L1523


## Impact
The delegateBySig function is completely broken. Users cannot delegate votes using signed messages, which is a core functionality for off-chain voting mechanisms. This severely limits the contract's usability and breaks compatibility with tools and interfaces expecting standard EIP-712 implementation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Correct the DOMAIN_TYPEHASH to include the version field:
```solidity
bytes32 public constant DOMAIN_TYPEHASH = keccak256("EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)");
```
