# A malicious user can cause voters in a gauge to loose rewards

## Summary
The `GaugeV4::notifyRewardAmount(...)` function is used to add rewards to the Gauge contract which is claimable by the voters. A malicious voter can steal these reward by calling `notifyRewardAmount(...)` with a dust amount of the token(s) he intends to steal.


## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: GaugeV4.sol
563:     function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
SNIP
.....
 
589:         require(rewardRate[token] > 0); 
590:         uint balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
591:         require(rewardRate[token] <= balance / DURATION, "Provided reward too high");
592:  >>>    periodFinish[token] = block.timestamp + DURATION;
593:         if (!isReward[token]) {
594:             isReward[token] = true;
595:             rewards.push(token);
596:         }
597: 
598:         emit NotifyReward(msg.sender, token, amount);
599:     }

```


- Alice and Bob both vote on a gauge for 1 epoch (WEEK)
- At the end of the epoch, FLOW emissions are distributed
- Alice calls `notifyRewardAmount(FLOW, 1 wei)` with 1 wei of FLOW token regularly, (she can do the every hour depending on how much she evaluates to profit from the attack) to extend the `periodFinish[FLOW]` beyond the end of the this next epoch when the rewards will be completely distributed and bob will withdraw his votes.
- Alice actions will extend the rewards distribution period  beyond the supposed end of the next epoch such that bob will not receive all his reward
- Alice then waits until the altered `periodFinish[FLOW]` ends to claim the remaining rewards distributed to the gauge including bobs supposed share

Also note, that a user who did not vote on the gauge can perform this attack to ensure funds are stuck in the contract after users withdraw without receiving all the rewards.
and the attack is cheap too


## Impact
- Theft of user reward through diluting other users rewards by extending the rewards distribution period
- Rewards can be stuck in the contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Increase the amount of rewards that can be added to a gauge if the caller is not the voter contract
