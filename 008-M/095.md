# gauge depositors may lose rewards because of the round down in `rewardRate`

## Summary
When we calculate the `rewardRate` in GaugeV4/Gauge, we use round down, and this will cause depositors lose some rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
In GaugeV4/Gauge, when voter or optionToken notify rewards, gauge will update the `rewardRate`. Here the `rewardRate` is round down. The maximum possible reward loss is `DURATION - 1`, which means 7*24*3600 -1 = 604799 amount reward token. 
We should not define this reward loss as the dust loss considering that this reward loss is one epoch's reward loss and more rewards will be lost in next epochs.
```javascript
    function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
        ...
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish[token]) {
            uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
            // @audit round down here.
            rewardRate[token] = amount / DURATION;
        } else {
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
```
### Poc
In below test case, we send 1e6 reward tokens to the gauge and the only depositor earn 604000(6e5), some reward tokens are stuck in the gauge contract.
```javascript
    function testPocRoundDown() public {
        deployFactory();
        stake.approve(address(gauge), 1e21);
        gauge.deposit(1e21, 1);
        FLOW.approve(address(gauge), TOKEN_1M);
        gauge.notifyRewardAmount(address(FLOW), 1e6);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);
        console.log(gauge.earned(address(FLOW), address(owner)));
    }
```
## Impact
Depositors will lose some reward tokens and the lost reward tokens will be stuck in the gauge contract.

## Recommendation
Store the rewardRate scaled by 1e18.
