# solmate's ERC20 does not check balance in _safeTransferFrom function.

## Summary
solmate's ERC20 does not check balance in _safeTransferFrom function.
## Vulnerability Detail

to use a token there is Specific contract requirements (Option Token contract).

in OptionTokenV4.sol contract the _safeTransferFrom function doesnt check the balance of `_from` address.here is _safeTransferFrom function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L762-L778
and it calles  `IERC20.transferFrom` from solmate's ERC20,
since the contract import solmate's ERC20:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L7
there is no Balance check in imported transferFrom function also :
https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/e0e9ff05d8aa5c7c48465511f85a6efdf5d5c30d/src/tokens/ERC20.sol#L90-L110
it looks bad import here.
## Impact
it can harmm the protocol.
