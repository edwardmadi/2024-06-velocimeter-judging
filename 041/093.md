# Oracle may be attacked if an attacker can pump the tokens for the entire block

## Summary
Attacker may use huge amount of their fund to pump the token in a liquidity pair for one entire block.
## Vulnerability Detail
Attacker may use huge amount of their fund to pump the token in a liquidity pair for one entire block. The oracle will capture the manipulated price as current TWAP implementation may only cover 1 block if timed correctly. (First block on every periodSize = 1800 minutes)
This is possible and similar to Inverse finance April attack: https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/02/defi-lender-inverse-finance-exploited-for-156-million/
Assume currently is the first block after periodSize = 1800 minutes
```solidity
 function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) internal {
        uint blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
            reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
            reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
        }

        Observation memory _point = lastObservation();
        timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _point.timestamp; // compare the last observation with current timestamp, if greater than 30 minutes, record a new event
        if (timeElapsed > periodSize) {
            observations.push(Observation(blockTimestamp, reserve0CumulativeLast, reserve1CumulativeLast));
        }
        reserve0 = balance0;
        reserve1 = balance1;
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }
```
timeElapsed > periodSize (Just greater as periodSize is just passed) -> add current cumulative reserve to observations list

Now, let pump the token. And use some technique that inverse finance hacker have used to hold that price for 1 block.
```solidity
function current(address tokenIn, uint amountIn) external view returns (uint amountOut) {
        Observation memory _observation = lastObservation();
        (uint reserve0Cumulative, uint reserve1Cumulative,) = currentCumulativePrices();
        if (block.timestamp == _observation.timestamp) {
            _observation = observations[observations.length-2];
        }

        uint timeElapsed = block.timestamp - _observation.timestamp;
        uint _reserve0 = (reserve0Cumulative - _observation.reserve0Cumulative) / timeElapsed;
        uint _reserve1 = (reserve1Cumulative - _observation.reserve1Cumulative) / timeElapsed;
        amountOut = _getAmountOut(amountIn, tokenIn, _reserve0, _reserve1);
    }
```
1 Block passed

reserve0Cumulative or reserve1Cumulative may now be skyrocketed due to current token pumping.

timeElapsed = block.timestamp - _observation.timestamp is less than 20 seconds (= 1 block) since _observation.timestamp has just stamped in the previous block.

As timeElapsed is less than 20 seconds (= 1 block) this mean _reserve0 and _reserve1 are just a TWAP of less than 20 seconds (= 1 block) which is easily manipulated by Inverse finance pumping attack technique.

## Impact
Attackers can manipulate the price return from `current`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
You should calculate TWAP average of _reserve0 and _reserve1 in the _update function by using cumulative reserve difference from last update to now which has a duration of periodSize = 1800 minutes.

And when querying for current price you can just return _reserve0 and _reserve1.
