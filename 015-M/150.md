# Users may be unable to execute the `swap()`

## Summary
In the `Pair.swap()` function, the protocol checks `amountxIn` instead of checking the fee before transferring the fee to `exBribes`. If one of the `amountIn` values is very small, the calculated fee could be 0. Since some tokens do not support 0 value transfers, this could cause the transaction to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Pair.swap()` function, if hasGauge is true, the protocol will transfer fee to exBribes. Note that the condition used here is `amount0In != 0` and `amount1In != 0`, instead of checking if fee != 0. 
```solidity
        if (hasGauge){
            if (amount0In != 0) _sendTokenFees(token0, fee0);
            if (amount1In != 0) _sendTokenFees(token1, fee1);
        } 

```

Some tokens do not support 0 transfers, which can cause user transactions to fail.

## Impact
Users cannot execute the swap().
