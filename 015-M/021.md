# `Pool` changes cause reverts on Small Swaps and on Fee set to 0

## Summary

Incorrect fee logic causes reverts anytime a fee is 0 or rounds down to 0


## MED - Reverting on Small Swaps and on Fee set to 0

## Vulnerability Detail

Pools will transfer fees to `externalBribe` via `notifyRewardAmount`, which will revert on a zero value:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/ExternalBribe.sol#L279-L280

```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
        require(amount > 0);
```

For pools that have low or zero fees, this will cause unintended DOS for swaps

## Impact
Pools with low fees may cause unintended DOS, pools with 0 fees (subsidized by emissions) are not possible

## Scope explanation

Per the scope docs:

```bash
Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?

No
```

Meaning that a low fee, as well as a zero fee are both legitimate values that the pool can have

In those cases, swaps that have the fee taken round down to zero, will revert due to the non-zero check

```solidity

        uint fee0 = amount0In * IPairFactory(factory).getFee(address(this)) / 10000;
        uint fee1 = amount1In * IPairFactory(factory).getFee(address(this)) / 10000;

        if (hasGauge){ 
            /// @audit should be checking for fee0 and fee1
            if (amount0In != 0) _sendTokenFees(token0, fee0); /// @audit Reverts on small swaps (0 fee)
            if (amount1In != 0) _sendTokenFees(token1, fee1);
        } 
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The check should be changed from
```solidity
if (amount0In != 0) _sendTokenFees(token0, fee0);
```

To

```solidity
if (fee0 != 0) _sendTokenFees(token0, fee0);
```
