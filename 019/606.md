# Voters who withdraw ve tokens risk losing gained bribes rewards

## Summary
Voters who withdraw their ve tokens without first claiming bribe rewards will permanently lose their rewards since the withdraw function does not automatically send the rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
When withdrawing ve tokens, token owners have to complete at least 3 steps:

(i) Call src/Voter.sol::reset(uint _tokenId) if they've voted
(ii) Call src/VotingEscrow.sol::withdraw(uint _tokenId)

The withdraw function burns the tokenId effectively handing over ownership to the address(0) as can be seen from this function:

```solidity
/**
     * @notice Remove a token from a given address
     * @dev Throws if `_from` is not the current owner.
     */
    function _removeTokenFrom(address _from, uint _tokenId) internal {
        // Throws if `_from` is not the current owner
        assert(idToOwner[_tokenId] == _from);
        // Change the owner
        idToOwner[_tokenId] = address(0);
        // Update owner token index tracking
        _removeTokenFromOwnerList(_from, _tokenId);
        // Change count tracking
        ownerToNFTokenCount[_from] -= 1;
    }
```

Once this is set, it becomes impossible for the owner of the token to claim any bribe rewards since  src/Voter.sol::claimBribes requires that the caller be owner or a permitted account:

```solidity
  function claimBribes(address[] memory _bribes, address[][] memory _tokens, uint _tokenId) external {
        require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));
        for (uint i = 0; i < _bribes.length; i++) {
            IBribe(_bribes[i]).getRewardForOwner(_tokenId, _tokens[i]);
        }
    }
```
Therefore, calling withdraw in order to close the token position before claiming bribe rewards will therefore permanently lock the rewards. 

## Impact
ve token owners risk permanently locking bribe rewards.
