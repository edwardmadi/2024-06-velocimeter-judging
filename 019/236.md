# If user has not claimed rewards prior to withdrawing their `veNFT`, they'll lose them.

## Summary
If user has not claimed rewards prior to withdrawing their `veNFT`, they'll lose them.

## Vulnerability Detail
In order to claim rewards for a `veNFT`, user has to be approved or owner.

```solidity
    function claim(uint _tokenId) external returns (uint) {
        require(IVotingEscrow(voting_escrow).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));

        if (block.timestamp >= time_cursor) _checkpoint_total_supply();
        uint _last_token_time = last_token_time;
        _last_token_time = _last_token_time / WEEK * WEEK;
        uint amount = _claim(_tokenId, voting_escrow, _last_token_time);
        if (amount != 0) {
            _safeTransfer(msg.sender,amount);
            token_last_balance -= amount;
        }
        return amount;
    }
```

The problem is that `withdraw` burns the NFT. If at the time of withdraw, user has had any unclaimed rewards, they'll remain forever stuck. It should also be considered that rewards in the distributor always lag at least a week.
