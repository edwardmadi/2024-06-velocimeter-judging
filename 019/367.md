# rewards are lost when merging and withdrawing tokens

## Summary
Owing to the implementation of the `VotingEscrow::withdraw(...)` and `VotingEscrow::merge(...)`  functions, rewards are lost when merging tokens  because rewards are not claimed before `_burn(...)` is called on the token.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `VotingEscrow::withdraw(...)` or `VotingEscrow::merge(...)` called by a user to withdraw a token or merge with another token as shown below,  unclaimed rewards must be claimed before burning the token. This prevents users from losing their rewards when the tokens are burnt. This isn't the case however as unclaimed rewards are not claimed before burning the token.
Hence, the tokens are burned without a means of retrieving the rewards entitled to it


```solidity
File: VotingEscrow.sol

955:     function withdraw(uint _tokenId) external nonreentrant { 
....
SNIP
970:         _checkpoint(_tokenId, _locked, LockedBalance(0,0));
971: 
972:         assert(IERC20(lpToken).transfer(msg.sender, value)); // @audit deos not claim rewards
973: 
974:         // Burn the NFT
975:  ->     _burn(_tokenId); // destroys approval and delegates token to a zero address
976: 
977:         emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _tokenId, value, block.timestamp);
978:         emit Supply(supply_before, supply_before - value);
979:     }



1195:     function merge(uint _from, uint _to) external { 
....
SNIP...
1207:         _checkpoint(_from, _locked0, LockedBalance(0, 0)); // @audit 5) does not claim before burning thus giving the to more power
1208:  ->     _burn(_from); 
1209:         _deposit_for(_to, value0, end, _locked1, DepositType.MERGE_TYPE); , 
1210:     }

```

Also note that this can lead to significant loss for protocols that want to integrate the VM protocol as well.


## Impact
This can lead to 
- loss for users rewards because the rewards are not claimed before burning the token.
- permanent freezing of unclaimed rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a mechanism for reward accrual and/or claiming during during withdrawal and merging before the token is burned
