# Incorrect evaluation of `point_history` from `VotingEscrow::_checkpoint(...)`

## Summary
In the `VotingEscrow::_checkpoint(...)` function, the `point_history[epoch]` state variable is updated within a for loop. The implementation of this update could lead to the use of incorrect block numbers to update the `point_history[epoch]`

## Vulnerability Detail
To do this, a **memory struct** called `last_point` is initialised with the last global point or with zero values of `bias` and `slope`, along with the current timestamp and block number, just in case it is called in the first epoch.
Another struct, initialLastPoint, is also initialised by directly assigning the previously declared lastPoint

```solidity

File: VotingEscrow.sol
598:     function _checkpoint( 
599:         uint _tokenId,
600:         LockedBalance memory old_locked,
601:         LockedBalance memory new_locked
602:     ) internal {
603:         Point memory u_old;
........
633: 
634:         Point memory last_point = Point({bias: 0, slope: 0, ts: block.timestamp, blk: block.number});
635:         if (_epoch > 0) {
636:  >>         last_point = point_history[_epoch];
637:         }
635:         uint last_checkpoint = last_point.ts;
```
Another struct, `initial_last_point`, is also initialised by directly assigning the previously declared `last_point`

```solidity
642:         Point memory initial_last_point = last_point;
```
then the loop start with the timestamp of the last Global checkpoint (`last_checkpoint`) and increments by weeks with each iteration.

```solidity
652:             uint t_i = (last_checkpoint / WEEK) * WEEK; // the exact beginging of the last checkpoint
653:             for (uint i = 0; i < 255; ++i) { // 51 weeks is 255 in 5 years
......
674:                 last_point.ts = t_i;
675:                 last_point.blk = initial_last_point.blk + (block_slope * (t_i - initial_last_point.ts)) / MULTIPLIER;
....
683:             }

```

The global `point_history` is updated at corresponding times with appropriate `bias` and `slope` in each iteration
the block number, it is extrapolated on a line with the current time and block number as endpoints, using the last recorded values in `initial_last_point` as the starting point..

The problem here is that `initial_last_point` and `last_point` both are pointing to the **same struct in memory**, instead of pointing to **separate copies** of it. This makes the entire calculation for updating the block number becomes incorrect.
Since the values of `t_i` and `initial_last_point.ts` will be the same, as `t_i` is read from `last_point`, which again points to the same struct as `initial_last_point`.

Therefor, during each iteration, `last_point.blk` will evaluate to the same `initial_last_point.blk` that was assigned initially

## Impact
- Incorrect block numbers are used to update the `point_history`
- All the functionalities that depend on the totalVoting voter power at particular block number will use incorrect values and can lead to exploit due to possible manipulation of voting power as well as broken accounting for the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `VotingEscrow::_checkpoint(...)` function to make `two separate memory copies` of the `point_history`

```diff
File: VotingEscrow.sol
598:     function _checkpoint( 
599:         uint _tokenId,
600:         LockedBalance memory old_locked,
601:         LockedBalance memory new_locked
602:     ) internal {
603:         Point memory u_old;
........
633: 
634:         Point memory last_point = Point({bias: 0, slope: 0, ts: block.timestamp, blk: block.number});
+              Point memory initial_last_point = Point({bias: 0, slope: 0, ts: block.timestamp, blk: block.number});
635:         if (_epoch > 0) {
636:             last_point = point_history[_epoch];
+636:            initial_last_point = point_history[_epoch];
637:         }
635:         uint last_checkpoint = last_point.ts;
