# `point_history` bias is updated with stale slope value everytime in `VotingEscrow:: _checkpoint(...)`

## Summary
The `VotingEscrow:: _checkpoint(...)` function is used to update the global `point_history` which also holds the `bias` and `slope` of the global state.

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown below on L661 for each complete epoch, the `slope_changes` is cached and added to the `last_point.slope` on L664. 

```solidity
File: VotingEscrow.sol
598:     function _checkpoint( // @audit does not increase number of check point of user in functions where it is called
........
649: 
650:         // Go over weeks to fill history and calculate what the current point is
651:         { 
652:             uint t_i = (last_checkpoint / WEEK) * WEEK; // the exact beginging of the last checkpoint
653:             for (uint i = 0; i < 255; ++i) { // 51 weeks is 255 in 5 years
654:                 // Hopefully it won't happen that this won't get used in 5 years!
655:                 // If it does, users will be able to withdraw but vote weight will be broken
656:                 t_i += WEEK;
657:                 int128 d_slope = 0;
658:                 if (t_i > block.timestamp) {
659:                     t_i = block.timestamp;
660:                 } else {
661:   >>>               d_slope = slope_changes[t_i];
662:  >>>            }
663:  >>>            last_point.bias -= last_point.slope * int128(int256(t_i - last_checkpoint)); // @audit red flag
664:                 last_point.slope += d_slope; // a rising slope becuse emission increase over time
..........
683:             }
684:         }
..........
733:     }

```
However, the `last_point.slope` is used to update the `last_point.bias` on L663. This done the wrong because if `t_i <= block.timestamp` (a complete epoch) the `last_point.bias` calculation will not reflect the slope`s change (differential) for the complete epoch's `slope_changes`  and as such this can return wrong results in the global voting `bias` calculation because a stale `last_point.slope` value (that contains `slope_changes` prior to the previous epoch) is used for accounting in this case.

Moreso, considering that the voting power decreases with time, using stale vale of `last_point.slope` to update `last_point.bias` breaks the accounting for the global point calculation and by extension all functions that depend on it.

## Impact
This breaks accounting for the protocol because a stale value is used to update the global point leading to a desync between the actual current epoch's value and the calculated value. 
This can as well be use to manipulate the voting power by a malicious user

## Recommendation
Modify the `VotingEscrow:: _checkpoint(...)` as shown below
