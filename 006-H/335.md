# Caching `totalSupply` leading to incorrect reward calculation


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L142

## Summary
The `checkpoint_total_supply` function in the `RewardDistributorV2` contract caches the total supply of tokens, potentially leading to incorrect reward calculations when a transaction is executed at the beginning of an epoch. This issue arises because the cached total supply value may become outdated if additional tokens are locked within the same epoch.

## Vulnerability Detail
RewardDistributor distributes tokens to users who locks the tokens in
`VotingEscrow`. Since the calculation of past supply is costly, the `rewardDistributorV2` cache the supply value in
`uint[1000000000000000] public ve_supply;`. The `checkpoint_total_supply` function iterates from the last updated time util the latest epoch time, fetches totalSupply from votingEscrow, and stores it. A potential issue arises when a transaction is executed at the beginning of an epoch, leading to an incorrect reward calculation. This issue stems from caching the total supply (totalSupply) value, which can still increase within the same epoch. 

```javascript
 function _checkpoint_total_supply() internal {
        address ve = voting_escrow;
        uint t = time_cursor;
        uint rounded_timestamp = block.timestamp / WEEK * WEEK;
        IVotingEscrow(ve).checkpoint();

        for (uint i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            if (t > rounded_timestamp) {
                break;
            } else {
                uint epoch = _find_timestamp_epoch(ve, t);
                IVotingEscrow.Point memory pt = IVotingEscrow(ve).point_history(epoch);
                int128 dt = 0;
                if (t > pt.ts) {
                    dt = int128(int256(t - pt.ts));
                }
                ve_supply[t] = Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt)), 0);
            }
            t += WEEK;
        }
        time_cursor = t;
    }

```

Proof Of Concept(POC)

Assume the following scenario when a transaction is executed at the beginning of an epoch.
1. The total supply` (totalSupply)` at the beginning of an epoch is X..
2. A user calls the `checkpoint_total_supply` function. The reward Distributor saves the totalSupply as X.
3. The same user then locks additional tokens, increasing their balance to 2X and the total supply to 3X.
4. When the reward distribution occurs, the user's reward is calculated based on their balance and the cached total supply value, which is now outdated.

The function checkpoint_total_supply is designed to iterate from the last updated time to the latest epoch time, fetching the total supply from VotingEscrow and storing it in the ve_supply array. Here is the part of the function highlighting the critical part:

```javascript
if (t > rounded_timestamp) {
                break;
            } else {
                uint epoch = _find_timestamp_epoch(ve, t);
                IVotingEscrow.Point memory pt = IVotingEscrow(ve).point_history(epoch);
                int128 dt = 0;
                if (t > pt.ts) {
                    dt = int128(int256(t - pt.ts));
                }
                ve_supply[t] = Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt)), 0);
            }                
```
In this code, the condition `if (t > rounded_timestamp)` breaks the loop if t > rounded_timestamp, but not if they are equal. This means that at the beginning of an epoch, when t is exactly equal to rounded_timestamp, the loop continues, and the total supply is cached prematurely.


## Impact
reward calculations may be based on outdated total supply data, leading to incorrect reward distribution. 

## Code Snippet
```javascript
function _checkpoint_total_supply() internal {
        address ve = voting_escrow;
        uint t = time_cursor;
        uint rounded_timestamp = block.timestamp / WEEK * WEEK;
        IVotingEscrow(ve).checkpoint();

        for (uint i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            if (t > rounded_timestamp) {
                break;
            } else {
                uint epoch = _find_timestamp_epoch(ve, t);
                IVotingEscrow.Point memory pt = IVotingEscrow(ve).point_history(epoch);
                int128 dt = 0;
                if (t > pt.ts) {
                    dt = int128(int256(t - pt.ts));
                }
                ve_supply[t] = Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt)), 0);
            }
            t += WEEK;
        }
        time_cursor = t;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Always fetch totalSupply from the votingEscrow every time is needed.

A quick fix would be to not to cache totalSupply when it can still increase.

```javascript
function _checkpoint_total_supply() internal {
    address ve = voting_escrow;
    uint t = time_cursor;
    uint rounded_timestamp = block.timestamp / WEEK * WEEK;
    IVotingEscrow(ve).checkpoint();

    for (uint i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
      +  if (t >= rounded_timestamp) {  // Updated condition
            break;
        } else {
            uint epoch = _find_timestamp_epoch(ve, t);
            IVotingEscrow.Point memory pt = IVotingEscrow(ve).point_history(epoch);
            int128 dt = 0;
            if (t > pt.ts) {
                dt = int128(int256(t - pt.ts));
            }
            ve_supply[t] = Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt)), 0);
        }
        t += WEEK;
    }
    time_cursor = t;
}

```

notice now we are using `if (t >= rounded_timestamp)` for quick fix.
