# RewardDistributorV2 caching `totalSupply` leading to incorrect reward calculation

## Summary
`RewardDistributorV2` distributes newly minted tokens to users who locks the tokens in `VotingEscrow`. Since the calculation of past supply is costly, the `RewardDistributorV2` cache the supply value in `uint[1000000000000000] public ve_supply`. The [RewardDistributorV2._checkpoint_total_supply](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L142-L163) function would iterate from the last updated time util the latest epoch time, fetches `totalSupply` from `votingEscrow`, and store it.

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume the following scenario when a transaction is executed at the beginning of an epoch.
   1. The totalSupply is X.
   2. The user calls checkpoint_total_supply. The rewardDistributorV2 save the totalSupply = X.
   3. The user creates a lock with 2X the amount of tokens. The user has balance = 2X and the totalSupply becomes 3X.
   4. Fast forward to when the reward is distributed. The user claims the tokens, reward is calculated by totalreward * balance / supply and user gets 2x of the total rewards.

## Impact
This can lead to a concentration of rewards among a few users, reducing the overall incentive for other users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The quick fix would be to stop `RewardDistributorV2` caching totalSupply when it can still increase.
```diff
     function _checkpoint_total_supply() internal {
        address ve = voting_escrow;
        uint t = time_cursor;
        uint rounded_timestamp = block.timestamp / WEEK * WEEK;
        IVotingEscrow(ve).checkpoint();

         for (uint i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
-             if (t > rounded_timestamp) {
+             if (t >= rounded_timestamp) {           
                  break;
               } else {
                  uint epoch = _find_timestamp_epoch(ve, t);
                  IVotingEscrow.Point memory pt = IVotingEscrow(ve).point_history(epoch);
                  int128 dt = 0;
                  if (t > pt.ts) {
                    dt = int128(int256(t - pt.ts));
                  }
                ve_supply[t] = Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt)), 0);
               }
               t += WEEK;
          }
          time_cursor = t;
     }
```
