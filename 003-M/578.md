# Unsafe casting in RewardsDistributorV2 leads to underflow of ve_for_at

## Vulnerability Detail
Solidity does not revert when casting a negative number to uint. Instead, it underflows to a large
number. In the RewardDistributor contract, the balance of a token at a specific time is calculated as follows:
```solidity
     IVotingEscrow.Point memory pt = IVotingEscrow(ve).user_point_history(_tokenId, epoch);
     return Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * (int128(int256(_timestamp - pt.ts))))), 0);
```
This is supposed to return zero when the calculated balance is a negative number. However, it underflows to a large number.

## Impact
This would lead to incorrect reward distribution if third-party protocols depend on this function, or when further updates make use of this codebase.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend following other parts of the codebase and returning zero for a negative number.
```solidity
     int256 result = int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * int128(int256(_timestamp - pt.ts)));
     if (result < 0) return 0;
     return uint256(result);
```
