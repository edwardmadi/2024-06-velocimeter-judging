# Unsafe casting in `RewardsDistributorV2` leads to underflow of `ve_supply`

## Summary
Underflow


## Vulnerability Detail
 Solidity does not revert when casting a negative number to uint. Instead, it underflows to a large
number. In the RewardDistributor contract, the ve_supply at specific time is calculated as follows:
```solidity
         ve_supply[t] = Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt)), 0);//@audit-issue 
```

This is supposed to return zero when the calculated balance is a negative number. However, it underflows to a large
number due to unsafe casting 




## Impact
This would lead to incorrect `ve_supply` values due to underflow.

## Recommendation

instead of casting from int256 to uint256 here directly:
 `  ve_supply[t] = Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt)), 0);`

leave it as int256 then use a check to return 0 if it is a negative number.

Here is what i mean:
```solidity
int256 veSupply =  int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt);
if (veSupply < 0) return 0;
ve_supply[t] = uint256(veSupply);
```
