# Unsafe casting in `RewardsDistributorV2` leads to underflow when calculating rewards

## Summary
Solidity does not revert when casting a negative number to uint. Instead, it underflows to a large number. In the RewardDistributor contract, the balance of a token at specific time can lead to silent overflow due to unsafe casting

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown below, the code does not check if the value returned for `balance_of` is negative, (considering that the user could have locked for less than 50 weeks and he is claiming his rewards for the first time after 50 weeks) since the point he lock his lp. 
```solidity
    function _claim(uint _tokenId, address ve, uint _last_token_time) internal returns (uint) {
        uint user_epoch = 0;
        .....

        for (uint i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
            ....
            } else {
                int128 dt = int128(int256(week_cursor - old_user_point.ts)); // week_cursor - 0
  @>>           uint balance_of = Math.max(uint(int256(old_user_point.bias - dt * old_user_point.slope)), 0); // overflow
```

Hence, the code is suppose to return zero when the calculated balance is a negative number however, it underflows silently to a large
number.
This would lead to incorrect reward distribution if for VM users and third-party protocols depend on this function because it may lead to 
- the claim function reverting for some users if there is not enough balance to claim
- some users may claim more than they are entitled to leading to a loss of funds for some user



## Impact
Loss of yield for users as there is a possibility of some users earning more yield than others

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the `_claim(...)` and `_claimable(...)` functions to check for possible negative values that may overflow when claiming rewards.
