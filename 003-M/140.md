# Unsafe casting in `RewardsDistributorV2::ve_for_at()` will cause underflow, leading to incorrect reward distribution for users

## Summary
 
## Vulnerability Detail

The [`RewardsDistributorV2`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol) contract manages the distribution of reward tokens to users based on their voting escrow balances and epochs, with mechanisms for checkpointing and claiming rewards. The [`ve_for_at()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L134-L140) function is a critical component of this system, as it calculates the balance of a user's ve tokens at a specific timestamp. This balance is then used to determine the user's share of rewards.

The [`ve_for_at()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L134-L140) function retrieves historical point data for a given token ID and calculates the balance using the formula:

```solidity
@>  pt.bias - pt.slope * (int128(int256(_timestamp - pt.ts)))
```

Where `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` are components of the user's point history, and `_timestamp` is the target time for the balance calculation.

The issue arises in the final step of this calculation. The result of the above formula can be negative, especially if the target timestamp is far in the future relative to the point's timestamp. However, the function attempts to cast this potentially negative `int256` value directly to a `uint256`:

```solidity
@>  return Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * (int128(int256(_timestamp - pt.ts))))), 0);
```

This unsafe casting can lead to an underflow when the result is negative, causing the function to return a very large number instead of zero. This incorrect balance calculation can significantly impact the reward distribution process, potentially leading to users receiving incorrect amounts of rewards.

## Impact
The unsafe casting in [`ve_for_at()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L134-L140) can lead to severe miscalculations in user balances, resulting in an unfair distribution of rewards. Users with expired or nearly expired ve tokens could be incorrectly assigned very large balances, entitling them to a disproportionate share of rewards. This not only undermines the intended tokenomics of the system but also potentially causes financial losses for other users who receive fewer rewards than they should.

The impact is particularly severe because the [`ve_for_at()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L134-L140) function is likely used in core reward calculation logic, meaning this issue could affect the entire reward distribution mechanism of the protocol.

## Proof of Concept
1. A user locks tokens in the voting escrow contract, receiving a ve token with ID 1.
2. Time passes, and the user's lock expires.
3. The protocol calls `ve_for_at(1, currentTimestamp)` to calculate the user's balance for reward distribution.
4. Due to the expired lock, the calculation `pt.bias - pt.slope * (int128(int256(_timestamp - pt.ts)))` results in a negative value.
5. This negative value is unsafely cast to `uint256`, resulting in a very large number.
6. The protocol uses this incorrectly large balance to calculate the user's share of rewards, leading to an unfair distribution.

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, implement a check for negative values before casting to `uint256`. Here's a suggested fix:

```diff
function ve_for_at(uint _tokenId, uint _timestamp) external view returns (uint) {
    address ve = voting_escrow;
    uint max_user_epoch = IVotingEscrow(ve).user_point_epoch(_tokenId);
    uint epoch = _find_timestamp_user_epoch(ve, _tokenId, _timestamp, max_user_epoch);
    IVotingEscrow.Point memory pt = IVotingEscrow(ve).user_point_history(_tokenId, epoch);
    
-   return Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * (int128(int256(_timestamp - pt.ts))))), 0);
+   int256 result = int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * int128(int256(_timestamp - pt.ts)));
+   if (result < 0) return 0;
+   return uint256(result);
}
```
