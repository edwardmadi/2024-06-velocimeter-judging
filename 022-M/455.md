# No decrease for `activeGaugeNumber`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

Anyone can call `update_period()`  once per epoch.
in [this line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Minter.sol#L117) it calculates the weekly emission just by this multiplication `activeGaugeNumber * weeklyPerGauge`
the `weeklyPerGauge` is predefined and `activeGaugeNumber` comes from `Voter.sol` and it is a changeable value 

Now, in case **emergencyCouncil** calls `Voter.sol#killGaugeTotally()` it should check if the gauge is active, if yes it needs to decrease the value of  `activeGaugeNumber` to avoid minting extra FLOW in the next epoch. because it will use an outdated value in the above multiplication.   

That extra FLOW will be leftover.

Although the leftover is absorbed during the next period because 
```solidity
   uint _balanceOf = _flow.balanceOf(address(this));
            if (_balanceOf < _required) {
                _flow.mint(address(this), _required - _balanceOf);
            }
```
But still leading to inflating the weekly emission for one epoch.

## Impact
The `Minter.sol` mints more `weekly_emission` than it should be.

## Recommendation
You can create a list of the `activeGauges` 
to easily check them when `killGaugeTotall()` gets triggered
