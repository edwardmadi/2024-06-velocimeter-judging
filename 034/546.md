# unhandled missed case in merge function


## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function merge(uint _from, uint _to) external {
    require(attachments[_from] == 0 && !voted[_from], "attached");
    require(_from != _to);
    require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _from));
    require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _to));

    LockedBalance memory _locked0 = locked[_from];
    LockedBalance memory _locked1 = locked[_to];
    uint value0 = uint(int256(_locked0.amount));
    uint end = _locked0.end >= _locked1.end ? _locked0.end : _locked1.end;

    locked[_from] = LockedBalance(0, 0);
    _checkpoint(_from, _locked0, LockedBalance(0, 0));
    _burn(_from);
    _deposit_for(_to, value0, end, _locked1, DepositType.MERGE_TYPE);
}
```

The bug here is that the function doesn't properly handle the case where the `_to` token has a longer lock time than the `_from` token. 

1. It correctly calculates the new end time as the maximum of the two lock end times.
2. However, when calling `_deposit_for`, it uses `value0` (the amount from the `_from` token) and `end` (the new end time), but it doesn't adjust the amount based on the potentially extended lock time.

This could lead to an unfair advantage where a user could merge a token with a shorter lock time into one with a longer lock time, effectively increasing their voting power without extending the lock on the merged-in tokens.
