# Use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom()

## Summary
The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC20 tokens that are not compliant with the specification could return false from the transfer and transferFrom functions call to indicate that the transfer fails, but the calling contract would not notice the failure if the return value is not checked.The EIP-20 specification requires to check the return value.In the `RewardsDistributorV2.notifyRewardAmount()` function, the protocol calls `transferFrom()` to obtain funds from `msg.sender`. There is a possibility that this transfer may not succeed, and the user may be unaware, which could impact the protocol's operation.


```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(_amount > 0, 'need to add at least 1 token');
        IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    }
```


## Impact
It affects the normal operation of the protocol.

## Recommendation
Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
