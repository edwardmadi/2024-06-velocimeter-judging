# Users can exploit vote persistence to earn unearned rewards via `Voter::poke`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The Voter contract in the protocol implements a voting mechanism where users can lock their tokens in a `VotingEscrow` (ve) contract and use the resulting `veNFTs` to vote on various pools. The voting power is meant to decay over time, reflecting the decreasing lock period of the `veNFTs`. However, the current implementation of the [`poke()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L234-L247) function in the Voter contract allows for potential exploitation of the voting and reward distribution system.

The [`poke()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L234-L247) function is designed to update a user's votes based on their current veNFT balance:

```solidity
function poke(uint _tokenId) external onlyNewEpoch(_tokenId) {
    require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId) || msg.sender == governor);
    lastVoted[_tokenId] = block.timestamp;

    address[] memory _poolVote = poolVote[_tokenId];
    uint _poolCnt = _poolVote.length;
    uint256[] memory _weights = new uint256[](_poolCnt);

    for (uint i = 0; i < _poolCnt; i ++) {
        _weights[i] = votes[_tokenId][_poolVote[i]];
    }

    _vote(_tokenId, _poolVote, _weights);
}
```

While this function does update the voting weights based on the current `veNFT` balance, it doesn't directly integrate with the reward distribution contracts. This creates a scenario where users can potentially maintain their voting power and continue earning rewards without actively managing their votes.

The root of the issue lies in the persistence of votes across epochs and the lack of a forced re-voting mechanism. Users can vote once and then avoid re-voting in subsequent epochs, allowing them to continue earning trading fees and bribes even as their actual voting power should be decaying.

## Impact

Unfair reward distribution allows users to earn disproportionate rewards, leading to financial losses for active users and undermining the protocol's incentive structure and efficiency.

## Proof of Concept
1. Alice locks her tokens in the VotingEscrow contract, receiving a veNFT.
2. Alice votes for Pool X using her veNFT through the `Voter::vote()` function.
3. In subsequent epochs, Alice avoids calling `vote()` or `poke()` on her own veNFT.
4. Alice's votes persist, and she continues to earn rewards from Pool X.
5. Bob, noticing Alice's outdated voting power, calls `poke()` on Alice's veNFT.
6. Alice's voting power is updated, but she has already earned rewards based on her previous, higher voting power.

Manual review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, consider implementing the following changes:

1. Integrate a decay mechanism directly into the reward distribution process:

```diff
function poke(uint _tokenId) external onlyNewEpoch(_tokenId) {
    require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId) || msg.sender == governor);
    lastVoted[_tokenId] = block.timestamp;

    address[] memory _poolVote = poolVote[_tokenId];
    uint _poolCnt = _poolVote.length;
    uint256[] memory _weights = new uint256[](_poolCnt);

    for (uint i = 0; i < _poolCnt; i ++) {
        _weights[i] = votes[_tokenId][_poolVote[i]];
    }

    _vote(_tokenId, _poolVote, _weights);
+   _updateRewardDistribution(_tokenId);
}

+ function _updateRewardDistribution(uint _tokenId) internal {
+     // Implement logic to update reward distribution based on current voting power
+ }
```

2. Implement a forced re-voting mechanism that requires users to re-vote periodically (e.g., every N epochs) to maintain their voting power.
3. Add incentives for active voting, such as bonus rewards for users who regularly update their votes.

##  Example Scenario:
### Before Mitigation

1. **Scenario**: Alice locks her tokens in the `VotingEscrow` contract, receiving a `veNFT` with a high initial voting power.
2. **Action**: Alice votes for Pool X using her `veNFT` through the `Voter::vote()` function.
3. **Exploit**: In subsequent epochs, Alice avoids calling `vote()` or `poke()` on her `veNFT`.
4. **Result**: Alice's votes persist, and she continues to earn rewards from Pool X based on her initial, higher voting power, even though her actual voting power should have decayed.

## After Mitigation

1. **Scenario**: Alice locks her tokens in the `VotingEscrow` contract, receiving a `veNFT` with a high initial voting power.
2. **Action**: Alice votes for Pool X using her `veNFT` through the `Voter::vote()` function.
3. **Mitigation**: The protocol now requires periodic re-voting and integrates a decay mechanism into the reward distribution process.
4. **Result**: 
    - If Alice avoids re-voting, her voting power decays, and the reward distribution process reflects this decay.
    - Alice must call `poke()` or re-vote periodically to maintain her voting power and earn rewards accurately based on her current `veNFT` balance.
