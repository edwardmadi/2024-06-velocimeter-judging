# Outdated Voting Power and Reward Distribution

## Summary
The Voter contract suffers from an issue where voting power and reward distribution do not automatically decay over time, potentially allowing users to receive rewards based on outdated voting power even after their locks have expired.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract's poke and _vote functions are designed to update a user's voting power, but they have several limitations:
* The poke function can be called by anyone, not just the token owner, as long as it's a new epoch.
* Voting power is only updated when poke or vote is called, not automatically over time.
* There's no mechanism to automatically adjust voting power as locks expire.

## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to several issues:
* Users are incentivized to vote early in their lock period to maximize their voting power.
* Users may continue to earn rewards based on their initial voting power even after their lock has expired.
* The system's voting power distribution may not accurately reflect the current state of locked tokens.
* Users can potentially manipulate the system by selectively updating (or not updating) voting power.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
* Implement an automatic decay mechanism for voting power that doesn't rely on external calls to poke.
* Update the reward distribution mechanism to consider the current, decayed voting power rather than the power at the time of the last vote.
* Automatically update voting power when distributing rewards or when users claim rewards.
* Implement a system-wide regular update of all voting power, perhaps on an epoch basis.
* Consider limiting the poke function to only be callable by the token owner or the contract itself.
```solidity
function distributeRewards(address _gauge) public {
    // ... existing code ...
    uint256 currentVotingPower = _calculateDecayedVotingPower(_tokenId);
    // Use currentVotingPower for reward calculation
    // ... rest of the function ...
}

function _calculateDecayedVotingPower(uint _tokenId) internal view returns (uint256) {
    // Implement decay calculation based on time since last vote and lock expiration
}
```
