# Bribe and fee token emissions can be gamed by users

## Vulnerability Detail
 A user may vote or reset their vote once per epoch. Votes persist across epochs and once a user
has distributed their votes among their chosen pools, the poke() function may be called by any user to update the target user's decayed veNFT token balance. However, the poke() function is not hooked into any of the reward distribution contracts.

## Impact
As a result, a user is incentivized to vote as soon as they create their lock and avoid re-voting in subsequent epochs. The amount deposited via Reward._deposit() does not decay linearly as how it is defined under veToken mechanics. Therefore, users could continue to earn trading fees and bribes even after their lock has expired. Simultaneously, users can poke() other users to lower their voting weight and maximize their own earnings.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Re-designing the contracts may be worthwhile to decay user deposits automatically.
