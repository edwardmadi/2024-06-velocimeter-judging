# the replace function doesn't properly  replace the pair and gauge factory

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
the **replaceFactory** function in voter.sol  takes two arguments and an index  that we are going to replace and the problem is that line 172 and 173 force the new arguments to have already  be  isFactory and isGaugeFactory to be true which means is that the new arguments  **_pairFactory** and _gaugeFactory have to be called in addFactory function  to pass line 172 and 173 check  and in line 179 and 180 they are trying to set the arguments into the provided index in other word this means that they are adding the provided   factories again 
## Impact
- we can't replace with the new pair factory and gauge  factory 
- we can't completely   use  **removeFactory** to completely remove the factories as they exists twice in **factories** and **gaugeFactories**  and we are only removing the first one  but they  still exist in         gaugeFactories even if they are turned off isFactory they will never be completely removed

Manual Review

## Recommendation
line 172 and 173 should make sure the new arguments aren't included instead of included
