# The `_safeApprove` lacks proper handling of allowance updates

## Summary
The `_safeApprove` function lacks proper handling of allowance updates, potentially leading to race conditions where the spender might use the current allowance before it is updated. This can result in unexpected behaviors and potential loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_safeApprove` function directly sets a new allowance for a spender without first setting the current allowance to zero. This can create a race condition if the spender front-runs the transaction and uses the current allowance before the new allowance is set.

The race condition arises because the `approve` function in ERC20 tokens does not guarantee atomic updates. If the allowance is not first set to zero, the spender can exploit the timing between the two transactions, leading to a situation where they can spend more tokens than intended.

## Impact
If an attacker is able to exploit this race condition, they can use the current allowance before it is updated, potentially spending more tokens than the contract owner intended. This can lead to unauthorized token transfers and significant loss of funds.

## Improved Implementation
```solidity
function _safeApprove(address token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
    require(token.code.length > 0, "Invalid token address");

    // Get the current allowance
    (bool successAllowance, bytes memory dataAllowance) =
        token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.allowance.selector, address(this), spender));
    require(successAllowance && dataAllowance.length >= 32, "Failed to get allowance");

    uint256 currentAllowance = abi.decode(dataAllowance, (uint256));

    // If the current allowance is not zero, set it to zero first
    if (currentAllowance != 0) {
        (bool successReset, bytes memory dataReset) =
            token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.approve.selector, spender, 0));
        require(successReset && (dataReset.length == 0 || abi.decode(dataReset, (bool))), "Failed to reset allowance");
    }

    // Set the new allowance
    (bool success, bytes memory data) =
        token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.approve.selector, spender, value));
    require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), "Failed to approve allowance");
}

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the `_safeApprove` function to first set the allowance to zero if the current allowance is not zero. This can be done by calling the `approve` function with a value of zero before setting the new allowance. This approach prevents race conditions and ensures the safe update of allowances.
