# Locks can be created for less than 1 epoch (1 WEEK)

## Summary
The `ve` LpToken has a minimum lock period of 1 epoch (1 weeks). However, a flaw allows malicious actors to lock their Ll tokens for less than 1 week, resulting in unfair FLOW emission reward distribution. This means a malicious actor can unfairly claim rewards without meeting the minimum 1-week lock requirement


## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is that the `unlock_time` calculation in the internal `_create_lock(...)` function is rounded down and is the validation of the calculated `unlock_time` only checks if this time is more than the current time. This wrong

```solidity
    function _create_lock(uint _value, uint _lock_duration, address _to) internal returns (uint) {
        uint unlock_time = (block.timestamp + _lock_duration) / WEEK * WEEK; // Locktime is rounded down to weeks
        
        require(_value > 0); // dev: need non-zero value
>>>     require(unlock_time > block.timestamp, 'Can only lock until time in the future');
        require(unlock_time <= block.timestamp + MAXTIME, 'Voting lock can be 52 weeks max');

```

- Thu Jul 25 2024 00:00:00 UTC is the start of the week
- alice a malicious user creates lock on Mon Jul 29 2024 00:00:00 UTC with `_lock_duration` = 3 days
- `(block.timestamp + _lock_duration) / WEEK * WEEK` rounds down to Thu Aug 1 2024 00:00:00 UTC
- `unlock_time > block.timestamp,` passes the check and lock is created
- rewards are distributed at the end of the epoch and she receives her portion as though she had locked for the whole time


This can also be detrimental for honest lockers as because the calculated unlock time can be less than users intended lock time making the user lock for less than their intended period.

- Thu Jul 25 2024 00:00:00 UTC is the start of the week
- Bob an honest user creates lock on Mon Jul 29 2024 00:00:00 UTC with `_lock_duration` = 7 days
- `(block.timestamp + _lock_duration) / WEEK * WEEK` rounds down to Thu Aug 1 2024 00:00:00 UTC
- `unlock_time > block.timestamp,` passes the check and lock is created
- Bobs unlock time is Thu Aug 1 2024 00:00:00 UTC (just 3 days after he locks)

**CODED POC**
Add the test case below to `VotingEscrow.t.sol` and run `forge test --mt testCreateLockBelowOneWeek -vvv`

```solidity
    function testCreateLockBelowOneWeek() public {
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), TOKEN_1);
        vm.warp(((block.timestamp / ONE_WEEK ) *  ONE_WEEK) + 4 days + 3);
        uint256 lockDuration = 3 * 24 * 3600; // 3 days

        // Balance should be zero before and 1 after creating the lock
        assertEq(escrow.balanceOf(address(owner)), 0);
        escrow.create_lock(TOKEN_1, lockDuration); // create lock for 3 days
        assertEq(escrow.currentTokenId(), 1);
        assertEq(escrow.ownerOf(1), address(owner));
        assertEq(escrow.balanceOf(address(owner)), 1);
    }
```


## Impact
- Malicious users can lock for less than the minimum lock period diluting reward for honest users and breaking accounting for the protocol
- honest users could be forced to lock for less than 1 week against their will due to rounding error

## Recommendation
In the `_create_lock(...)` function to ensure the check handles the full range of the users lock time parammeter and it must not be less than one week
```diff
    function _create_lock(uint _value, uint _lock_duration, address _to) internal returns (uint) {
-       uint unlock_time = (block.timestamp + _lock_duration) / WEEK * WEEK; // Locktime is rounded down to weeks
        
        require(_value > 0); // dev: need non-zero value
-        require(unlock_time > block.timestamp, 'Can only lock until time in the future');
+        require(unlock_time == block.timestamp + _lock_duration, 'Can only lock until time in the future');
        require(unlock_time <= block.timestamp + MAXTIME, 'Voting lock can be 52 weeks max');
