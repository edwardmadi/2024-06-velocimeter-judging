# Voter Contract's Initialization Function Vulnerable to Multiple Invocation in Voter.sol

## Summary
The initialize function in the Voter contract should only be callable once during initialization. However, it can currently be called more than once. In the interest of predictability and clarity, consider applying the initializer modifier to guarantee that any initialize functions can only be called once during initialization.

https://github.com/ThomasHeim11/velcomiter/blob/e0c17462b71c73c00f37420697cc7373ea9ab8d8/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L113-L119

## Vulnerability Detail
The initialize function can be called multiple times, allowing reinitialization. This can lead to potential misuse, as the initialize function might perform critical operations like setting up the initial state of the contract. If called more than once, it can overwrite the existing state, leading to unpredictable behavior or security vulnerabilities.

## Impact
Allowing the initialize function to be called multiple times can cause significant issues, including but not limited to:

- Reinitialization of critical variables leading to a reset or unintended state of the contract.
Potential security vulnerabilities as the reinitialization could be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized control or disrupt the contract's operation.

- Loss of predictability and clarity in the contract's behavior, which is critical for maintaining trust and reliability.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
function initialize(address[] memory _tokens, address _minter) external {
    require(msg.sender == minter);
    for (uint i = 0; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
        _whitelist(_tokens[i]);
    }
    minter = _minter;
}

```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

To ensure that the initialize function can only be called once during initialization, apply the initializer modifier. This guarantees that the function cannot be called more than once, preserving the integrity of the initialization process. The updated code snippet would look like this:

```javascript
contract Voter is Initializable {
    function initialize(address[] memory _tokens, address _minter) external initializer {
        require(msg.sender == minter);
        for (uint i = 0; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
            _whitelist(_tokens[i]);
        }
        minter = _minter;
    }
}
```

By incorporating the initializer modifier from OpenZeppelin's library, we ensure that the initialize function is protected against multiple calls, thereby enhancing the security and reliability of the contract.
