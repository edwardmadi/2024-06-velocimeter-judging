# Minter will get DoS'd in certain scenario

## Summary
Minter will get DoS'd in certain scenario

## Vulnerability Detail
At the end of Minter's `update_period`, within the event, `circulating_supply` is called.

```solidity
            _voter.notifyRewardAmount(weekly);

            emit Mint(msg.sender, weekly, circulating_supply());
```

```solidity
    // calculate circulating supply as total token supply - locked supply
    function circulating_supply() public view returns (uint) {
        return _flow.totalSupply() - _ve.totalSupply();
    }
```

The problem is that `circulating_supply` does something completely wrong. It deducts the linearly decaying `ve.totalSupply` from the flow token's totalsupply. This is wrong for 2 reasons, the main one being that the deposited token in the `ve` is the `FLOW/paymentToken` lp token (and not flow token).  Depending on token prices, the total LP supply can easily exceed the total supply of the `flow` token. If enough of it is deposited within the `VotingEscrow`, this line of code here will revert due to underflow and will brick all future emissions until the total ve balance decays enough.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The way to calculate circulating supply would be to calculate the used FLOW based on `ve.supply` and liquidity pool's token reserves
