# h-06 lack of a event that are emitted and the delays at the admin functions 0xaliyah

## Summary

0xaliyah

title: Lack of Event Emissions and Delays in Admin Functions

1. certain function `deployGauge`, `whitelist`, and `blacklist` in the `ProxyGaugeFactory` contract required the owner role but did not emit events or implemented delays, and potentially to cause potentially transparency and security issues

## Vulnerability Detail

1. at `deployGauge` function no emitted events or mandatory delays owner has deploy a new gauge contract and whitelist it
2. at `whitelist` function whitelist without any event emission or delay by owner
3. at `blacklist` function owner will remove any address from the whitelist without the event emission or delay

## Impact

1. high impact and medium likeliness owasp for `deployGauge` function and medium impact and medium likeliness owasp for `whitelist` function and the `blacklist` function
2. transparency for investors

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. the time-lock mechanism for the sensitive functions
5. the two-step process with the mandatory delay for the impact changes
