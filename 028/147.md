# `OptionTokenV4.sol#updateGauge` function has no authority check.

## Summary
`OptionTokenV4.sol#updateGauge` function has no authority check.
This issue make useless the `OptionTokenV4.sol#setGauge` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `OptionTokenV4.sol#setGauge` function is the following.
```solidity
418:/// @notice Sets the gauge address when the gauge is not listed in Voter. Only callable by the admin.
    /// @param _gauge The new treasury address
    function setGauge(address _gauge) external onlyAdmin {
        gauge = _gauge;
        emit SetGauge(_gauge);
    }
```
By comment in `L418`, the administrator calls this function to set gauge when the gauge is not listed in voter.

On the other hand, the `OptionTokenV4.sol#updateGauge` function is the following.
```solidity
    function updateGauge() external {
        address newGauge = IVoter(voter).gauges(address(pair));
        gauge = newGauge;
        emit SetGauge(newGauge);
    }
```
Anyone can call the above function and set the gauge which is listed in voter.

Scenario:
1. Administrator calls `OptionTokenV4.sol#setGauge` function and set the gauge which is not listed in voter.
2. Attacker calls `OptionTokenV4.sol#updateGauge` function and revert the gauge back to the gauge which is listed in voter.

## Impact
Anyone can make useless the `OptionTokenV4.sol#setGauge` function.
That is, the administrator can't set the gauge which is not listed in voter.
