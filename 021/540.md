# depositFor function should be restricted to approved NFT types.

## Summary
As the title suggests, `depositFor` function should be restricted to approved NFT types.
## Vulnerability Detail
 The `depositFor` function was found to accept NFT of all types (normal, locked, managed) without
restriction.

```solidity
function depositFor(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _value) external nonReentrant {
  LockedBalance memory oldLocked = _locked[_tokenId];
  require(_value > 0, "VotingEscrow: zero amount");
  require(oldLocked.amount > 0, "VotingEscrow: no existing lock found");
  require(oldLocked.end > block.timestamp, "VotingEscrow: cannot add to expired lock, withdraw");
  _depositFor(_tokenId, _value, 0, oldLocked, DepositType.DEPOSIT_FOR_TYPE);
}
```
Users should not be allowed to increase the voting power of a locked NFT by calling the depositFor function as
locked NFTs are not supposed to vote. Thus, any increase in the voting balance of locked NFTs will not increase
the gauge weight, and as a consequence, the influence and yield of the deposited FLOW will be diminished
## Impact
Users should not be allowed to increase the voting power of a locked NFT by calling the depositFor function as
locked NFTs are not supposed to vote
