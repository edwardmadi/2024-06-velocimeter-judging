# Claimable gauge distributions are locked when killGaugeTotally or pauseGauge is called


## Summary
When a gauge is killed in the Voter contract, the claimable rewards associated with that gauge are permanently locked.
This occurs because the `claimable[_gauge]` key value is cleared, preventing any rewards received by the Voter contract from being distributed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises when a gauge is killed in the Voter contract, which results in the clearing of the `claimable[_gauge]` key value.
Consequently, any rewards indexed and distributed by the Voter contract in proportion to each pool's weight are locked within the contract and cannot be accessed or distributed.

## Impact
Permanently locked rewards within the Voter contract, leading to an inefficient reward distribution system.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, consider the following steps:
Return the claimable amount to the `Minter` contract when a gauge is killed or paused. This ensures that rewards are not permanently locked within the `Voter` contract.
