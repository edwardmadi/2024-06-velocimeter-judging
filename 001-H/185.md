# Incorrect Handling of Gauge Rewards in `pauseGauge` and `killGaugeTotally` Functions of Voter Contract

## Summary
The `pauseGauge` and `killGaugeTotally` functions in the Voter contract fail to claim the gauge rewards allocated to that gauge, resulting in these rewards being permanently locked in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Voter` contract, the rewards allocated to the gauge are claimed using the [`distribute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L549-L562) function.
However, the `pauseGauge()` and `killGaugeTotally()` functions reset the gauge's claimable value without claiming the corresponding gauge rewards.

1. Voter.sol/pauseGauge():
```solidity
    function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
        SNIP...
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");
        isAlive[_gauge] = false;
-->     claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        SNIP...
    }
```
2. Voter.sol/killGaugeTotally():
```solidity
    function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
        SNIP...

        delete isGauge[_gauge];
-->     delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];

        SNIP...
    }
```
This ensures that the gauge will not have rewards in the next epoch but also results in unclaimed rewards being permanently locked in the contract.
Before resetting the claimable value, the gauge rewards are not claimed, resulting in permanently locked rewards in the contract.

## Impact
Some gauge rewards remain unclaimed and permanently locked in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add the following code to the `pauseGauge()` and `killGaugeTotally()` functions:
```solidity
    IMinter(minter).update_period();
    _updateFor(_gauge); // should set claimable to 0 if killed
    uint _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
    if (_claimable > IGauge(_gauge).left(base) && _claimable / DURATION > 0) {
        claimable[_gauge] = 0;

        IGauge(_gauge).notifyRewardAmount(base, _claimable);
        emit DistributeReward(msg.sender, _gauge, _claimable);
    }
```
