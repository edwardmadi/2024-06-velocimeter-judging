# Claimable gauge distributions are lost when `killGaugeTotally` is called

## Summary
The claimable gauge rewards will be deleted when a gauge is killed, and the entire amount will be permanently lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
when `killGaugeTotally` function is called the `claimable[_gauge]` deleted without checking value so this can lead to losing calimable flow tokens.

this is `killGaugeTotally()` function and we can see there is no check for value of `claimable[_gauge];` :

```solidity
function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugeKillAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Restart gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");
        //@audit SP VALID MED should return claimable back to minter
        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];

        delete isAlive[_gauge];
        delete external_bribes[_gauge];
        delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
        delete isGauge[_gauge];
        delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

        killedGauges.push(_gauge);

        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }
```
## Impact
Losing claimable accounted Gauge flow tokens. because when `killGaugeTotally` called there is no check for claimable flow tokens and all the records would be gone.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugeKillAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Restart gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");
        //@audit SP VALID MED should return claimable back to minter
        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];

        delete isAlive[_gauge];
        delete external_bribes[_gauge];
        delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
        delete isGauge[_gauge];
        delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

        killedGauges.push(_gauge);

        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }
```

Manual Review
## Recommendation
consider returning claimable value to minter.
