# The `Voter.killGaugeTotally` function lock theh claimable gauge distributions in the `Voter` contract

## Summary

The `Voter` contract distributes `claimable[_gauge]` amount of rewards in proportion to each pool's weight.
In the `Voter.killGaugeTotally` function, it deletes the `claimable[_gauge]` variable for the gauge.
As a result, `claimable[_gauge]` amount of rewards are locked in the contract permanently.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Voter` contract distributes `claimable[_gauge]` amount of rewards in proportion to each pool's weight from L528.

```solidity
        function _updateFor(address _gauge) internal {
                address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];
                uint256 _supplied = weights[_pool];
                if (_supplied > 0) {
                uint _supplyIndex = supplyIndex[_gauge];
                uint _index = index; // get global index0 for accumulated distro
                supplyIndex[_gauge] = _index; // update _gauge current position to global position
                uint _delta = _index - _supplyIndex; // see if there is any difference that need to be accrued
                if (_delta > 0) {
                        uint _share = uint(_supplied) * _delta / 1e18; // add accrued difference for each supplied token
                        if (isAlive[_gauge]) {
L528:                       claimable[_gauge] += _share;
                        }
                }
                } else {
                supplyIndex[_gauge] = index; // new users are set to the default global state
                }
        }
```

In the `Voter.killGaugeTotally` function, it deletes the `claimable[_gauge]` variable for the gauge from L421.

```solidity
        function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
                if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
                require(
                        IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugeKillAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
                , "Restart gauge not allowed");
                }
                require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");

                address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];

                delete isAlive[_gauge];
                delete external_bribes[_gauge];
                delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
                delete isGauge[_gauge];
L421:           delete claimable[_gauge];
                delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
                delete gauges[_pool];
                try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

                killedGauges.push(_gauge);

                emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
        }
```

If the gauge is killed before claiming the `claimable[_gauge]` amount of rewards, rewards are locked in the `Voter` contract permanently.

## Impact

`claimable[_gauge]` amount of rewards for killed gauge are locked in the `Voter` contract permanently.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to change the code as follows:

```diff
        function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
                if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
                require(
                        IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugeKillAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
                , "Restart gauge not allowed");
                }
                require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");

                address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];

                delete isAlive[_gauge];
                delete external_bribes[_gauge];
                delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
                delete isGauge[_gauge];
                delete claimable[_gauge];
                delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
                delete gauges[_pool];
                try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

                killedGauges.push(_gauge);
+               base.transfer(minter, claimable[_gauge]);
                emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
        }
```
