# Some claimable gauge rewards will be locked if the gauge is killed

## Summary
If one gauge is killed, the claimable rewards cannot be claimed and will be locked in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Voter contract, miner contract will notify reward once per epoch. These rewards will be distributed to different gauges. The rewards will be distributed in proportion according to each pool's weight.
The vulnerability is that if one gauge is killed, the `claimable` rewards will be locked within the contract.

```javascript
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == minter,"not a minter");
        activeGaugeNumber = 0;
        currentEpochRewardAmount = amount;
        _safeTransferFrom(base, msg.sender, address(this), amount); // transfer the distro in
        uint256 _ratio = amount * 1e18 / totalWeight; // 1e18 adjustment is removed during claim
        if (_ratio > 0) {
            index += _ratio;
        }
    }
    function _updateFor(address _gauge) internal {
        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];
        uint256 _supplied = weights[_pool];
        if (_supplied > 0) {
            uint _supplyIndex = supplyIndex[_gauge];
            uint _index = index; // get global index0 for accumulated distro
            supplyIndex[_gauge] = _index; // update _gauge current position to global position
            uint _delta = _index - _supplyIndex; // see if there is any difference that need to be accrued
            if (_delta > 0) {
                uint _share = uint(_supplied) * _delta / 1e18; // add accrued difference for each supplied token
                if (isAlive[_gauge]) {
                    claimable[_gauge] += _share;
                }
            }
        } else {
            supplyIndex[_gauge] = index; // new users are set to the default global state
        }
    }

```

## Impact
Some rewards will be locked within the contract.

## Recommendation
Returning the `claimable` amount to the miner contract.
