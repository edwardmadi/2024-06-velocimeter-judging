# Any accrued rewards are lost when a gauge is paused

## Summary
When a gauge is paused, `claimable[gauge]` is set to 0. Any funds that aren't claimed by then are lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
```sol
    function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
        // ...
        claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        // ...
    }
```

Pausing a gauge will reset the `claimable` amount for that gauge to 0.
