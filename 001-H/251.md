# Paused gauge will continue to accrue funds that aren't claimable

## Summary
When a gauge is paused it will still be rewarded oFLOW each epoch which won't be claimable even if the gauge is unpaused in the future.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a gauge is paused, the `isAlive` state variable is set to false.

While a gauge is paused, you're still able to call `updateFor()` for that gauge. That will update the gauge's `supplyIndex` but won't add the accrued rewards to the `claimable` amount:

```sol
    function _updateFor(address _gauge) internal {
        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];
        uint256 _supplied = weights[_pool];
        if (_supplied > 0) {
            uint _supplyIndex = supplyIndex[_gauge];
            uint _index = index; // get global index0 for accumulated distro
            supplyIndex[_gauge] = _index; // update _gauge current position to global position
            uint _delta = _index - _supplyIndex; // see if there is any difference that need to be accrued
            if (_delta > 0) {
                uint _share = uint(_supplied) * _delta / 1e18; // add accrued difference for each supplied token
                // @audit paused gauges will have their supplyIndex increased without adding accrued funds to claimable
                if (isAlive[_gauge]) {
                    claimable[_gauge] += _share;
                }
            }
        } else {
            supplyIndex[_gauge] = index; // new users are set to the default global state
        }
    }
```

Thus, any gauge that's paused will keep accruing rewards but those rewards won't be claimable by anyone. Effectively, they are locked up.

## Impact
Having a paused gauge accrue funds takes away rewards from the other gauges. The gauge's accrued rewards are also lost.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Two possibilities:

1. don't allow `updateFor()` to be callable for paused gauges such that it's callable after the gauge is unpaused. That way the rewards will be added to the gauge after it's unpaused and distributed to the users.
2. keep increasing gauge's supplyIndex but don't account for that gauge when rewards are distributed such that the rewards are only shared between active gauges.
