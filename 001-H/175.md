# Incorrect handling of gauge rewards in `pauseGauge` and `killGaugeTotally` functions of `Voter` contract.

## Summary
In the 'pauseGauge' and 'killGaugeTotally' functions of the 'Voter' contract, the gauge rewards assigned to that gauge so far are not claimed. As a result, gauge rewards are permanently locked into the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the 'Voter' contract, the rewards allocated to the gauge so far are claimed using the `distribute()` function.
```solidity
    function distribute(address _gauge) public lock {
        IMinter(minter).update_period();
        _updateFor(_gauge); // should set claimable to 0 if killed
        uint _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
        if (_claimable > IGauge(_gauge).left(base) && _claimable / DURATION > 0) {
            claimable[_gauge] = 0;
            if((_claimable * 1e18) / currentEpochRewardAmount > minShareForActiveGauge) {
                activeGaugeNumber += 1;
            }

            IGauge(_gauge).notifyRewardAmount(base, _claimable);
            emit DistributeReward(msg.sender, _gauge, _claimable);
        }
    }
```
Meanwhile, the `pauseGauge()` and `killGaugeTotally()` functions reset the gauge's claimable value to ensure that it is not going to have rewards on the next epoch.
1. [Voter.sol/pauseGauge()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L388)
```solidity
    function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
        SNIP...
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");
        isAlive[_gauge] = false;
388:    claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        SNIP...
    }
```
2. [Voter.sol/killGaugeTotally()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L421)
```solidity
    function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
        SNIP...

        delete isAlive[_gauge];
        delete external_bribes[_gauge];
        delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
        delete isGauge[_gauge];
421:    delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

        SNIP...
    }
```
However, as you can see, before resetting the claimable value of the gauge, the corresponding gauge rewards are not claimed.
Therefore, the generated gauge rewards is not claimed and is permanently locked in the contract.
## Impact
Some gauge rewards is not claimed and is permanently locked in the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add the following code to the 'pauseGauge()' and 'killGaugeTotally()' functions:
```solidity
    function pauseGauge(address _gauge){
        SNIP...

        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");

+++     IMinter(minter).update_period();
+++     _updateFor(_gauge); // should set claimable to 0 if killed
+++     uint _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
+++     if (_claimable > IGauge(_gauge).left(base) && _claimable / DURATION > 0) {
+++         claimable[_gauge] = 0;
+++         IGauge(_gauge).notifyRewardAmount(base, _claimable);
+++         emit DistributeReward(msg.sender, _gauge, _claimable);
+++     }

        isAlive[_gauge] = false;
        claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        
        SNIP...

    }
```
