# Pausing or killing the gauge leads to the stuck tokens inside the `Voter` contract.

## Summary
File: [`Voter.sol`]

The `pauseGauge(...)` and `killGaugeTotally(...)` functions lock already given/minted tokens inside the `Voter` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `updateFor(...)` function updates the `claimable[_gauge]` mapping with the portion of rewards the gauge should receive, based on the number of votes for the pool stored in `weights[pool]`.

When `pauseGauge(...)` and `killGaugeTotally(...)` are called, they reset `claimable[_gauge]` to zero. However, some tokens may already be allocated to the gauge before it is paused or killed. Resetting this mapping prevents these tokens from being distributed, effectively locking them in the contract.

Additionally, `weights[_pool]` are not reset when a gauge is paused or killed. During `updateFor(...)`, rewards shares are still theoretically allocated to the paused/killed gauge, but `claimable` is not updated, causing the rewards to remain stuck inside the `Voter` contract.

## Impact
Reward tokens inside the `Voter` contract will be locked, and there is no way to claim them back once the `claimable[_gauge]` is updated and a gauge is paused or killed.

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a solution similar to Velodrome Finance: send all outstanding rewards back to the `Minter` contract during the `updateFor(...)` call and before pausing/killing.
