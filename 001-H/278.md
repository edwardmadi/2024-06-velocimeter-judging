# Claimable gauge distributions are locked when pauseGauge is called

## Summary

The pauseGauge function in the Voter contract resets the claimable rewards to zero, potentially leading to permanent loss of accrued rewards of users.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the pauseGauge function, the [claimable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L388) rewards is reset to 0 

`claimable[_gauge] = 0`

What this implies is that, any rewards that are accrued by users before pausing the gauge will be lost forever when the guage is being paused as it resets the rewards to 0


## Impact

Users will lose access to rewards earned before the pause of which will be permanently locked in the contract

## Recommendation

Consider returning the claimable amount to the Minter contract rather than resetting it to 0
