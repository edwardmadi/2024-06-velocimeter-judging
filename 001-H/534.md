# Pausing and resuming gauge deletes its' rewards

## Summary
Title
## Vulnerability Detail
Pausing a gauge sets its' current claimable to 0 [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L388), however restarting it restores its' status to alive but does not resume the previous claimable amount.

Let's take a look at `_updateFor` method and example assumptions in in-line comments
```solidity
    function _updateFor(address _gauge) internal {
        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];
        uint256 _supplied = weights[_pool];
        if (_supplied > 0) {
            uint _supplyIndex = supplyIndex[_gauge];                // supplyIndex = 1 (from last week)
            uint _index = index;                                    // _index = 1.1
            supplyIndex[_gauge] = _index;                           // update supplyIndex to 1.1
            uint _delta = _index - _supplyIndex;                    // fetch their difference
            if (_delta > 0) {
                uint _share = uint(_supplied) * _delta / 1e18;      // assign share based on difference
                if (isAlive[_gauge]) {
                    claimable[_gauge] += _share;                    // adds the share to existing claimable
                }                                                   // @audit undistributed claimable[_gauge] will be lost if the gauge is paused-unpaused
            }
        } else {
            supplyIndex[_gauge] = index; 
        }
    }
```
Imagine the following scenario:
Week 1, `distribute` is called, `_updateFor(gauge)` is invoked, claimable[_gauge] increments with some amount
```solidity
        _updateFor(_gauge);                                                         // @note claimable[_gauge] increases here
        uint _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
        if (_claimable > IGauge(_gauge).left(base) && _claimable / DURATION > 0) { 
            claimable[_gauge] = 0;                                                  // @note only reset if _claimable > left
            ...
        }
```
In week 1, _claimable is less than `left`, no rewards would be distributed, claimable is stored until it satisfies the if-statement
In week 2 the gauge is paused and unpaused by the emergency council, claimable would be set to 0 and won't be restored afterwards
`distribute` is invoked, _updateFor will add `_share` for the respective week to an already 0'd claimable[_gauge] from last week

## Impact
Claimable amount is lost and permanently locked within the contract
## Code Snippet
```solidity   
 function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugePauseAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Pause gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");
        isAlive[_gauge] = false;
        claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        address _pair = IGauge(_gauge).stake(); // TODO: add test cases
        try IPair(_pair).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}
        emit GaugePaused(_gauge);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Store the claimable value upon pause and restore it once the gauge is unpaused
