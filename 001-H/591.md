# Claimable gauge distributions are locked when killGaugeTotally is called

## Vulnerability Detail
When a gauge is killed, the claimable[_gauge] key value is cleared. Because any rewards received
by the Voter contract are indexed and distributed in proportion to each pool's weight, this claimable amount is permanently locked within the contract.
```solidity
421        delete claimable[_gauge];
```

## Impact
claimable amount is permanently locked within the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider returning the _claimable_ amount to the _Minter_ contract. It is important to note that
votes will continue to persist on the killed gauge, so it may also make sense to wipe these votes too. Otherwise, the killed gauge will continue to accrue rewards from the _Minter_ contract.
