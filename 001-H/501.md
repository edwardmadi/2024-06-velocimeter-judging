# Claimable gauge distributions are locked when `pauseGauge` is called

## Summary

When a gauge is paused there are several storage parameters being updated, including the `claimable[_gauge]`, causing them to be locked.

## Vulnerability Detail

Because any rewards received by the `Voter` contract are indexed and distributed in proportion to each pool's weight, this claimable amount is permanently locked within the contract. Although this function is only accessible by the `emergencyCouncil` and "Any change of the settings is reviewed by all core team members.". This however isn't necessarily a setting being set but an action that will always lock out any claimable gauge distributions for said guage. 

## Impact
Any paused guage will have their claimable distributions locked even if reopened with `restartGauge`.

## Recommendation
Consider returning the claimable amount to the `Minter` contract.
