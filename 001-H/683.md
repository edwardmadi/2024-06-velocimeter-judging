# Claimable rewards are permanently locked in Voter.sol when `killGaugeTotally()` is called

## Summary
When a gauge is killed, its associated claimable rewards are permanently lost. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The Voter.sol contract manages the gauge of a given Pool and is responsible for pausing, restarting and killing gauges. When a gauge is killed, the `claimable[_gauge]` key value is deleted and because each pool is indexed and has it's rewards distributed based on the pool's weight; rewards meant for the pool with the killed gauge will be permanently stuck in the Voter contract.
```solidity
function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
      //function logic

        delete isGauge[_gauge];
        delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

     // more function logic
    }
 ```
## Impact
Permanent freezing of accumulated rewards for the pool.

## Recommendation
When a gauge is deactivated, the unclaimed rewards associated with it should be addressed. One option is to return these rewards to the Minter contract or a designated recovery contract. Additionally, given that votes cast for a deactivated gauge remain active, it might be prudent to clear these votes to prevent further reward accumulation. This prevents resources from being allocated to a non-functional gauge.
