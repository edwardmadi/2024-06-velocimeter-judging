# `isApprovedOrOwner` don't check delegates

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

`VotingEscrow.sol` has a delegation system.
so, users with veNFT call `delegate()`/`delegateBySig()` to delegate their votes to `delegatee`
In case Alice owns veNFT_01  and she decides to `delegate()` it to Bob

Now, Bob will trigger `Voter.sol#vote()` the flow needs to go through [isApprovedOrOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L295-L303) successfully 
```solidity
File: Voter.sol

368:     function vote(
SNIP
373:         require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, tokenId));

```
by digging into `isApprovedOrOwner()` only checks `spenderIsOwner`, `spenderIsApproved`, and `spenderIsApprovedForAll`
But, it is not checking the delegates.
So, we have two things after Alice delegates to Bob:
1-  Alice is still able to `vote()`
2- Bob can't `vote()`
because `vote()` is using `IVotingEscrow(_ve).balanceOfNFT(_tokenId);` to get the NFT weight.


## Impact
The delegation system does not work because Alice is still able to `vote()` even if she delegates to Bob at the same time Bob can't  `vote()`

## Code Snippet
Foundry PoC:
Please copy the following POC in `votingescrow.t.sol`

```solidity
        function testDelegationError() public {
        address tempDelegate = makeAddr("tempDelegate");
        console.log(flowDaiPair.balanceOf( owners[0]));
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), 100 * TOKEN_1);
        uint256 lockDuration = 7 * 24 * 3600; // 1 week
        assertEq(escrow.balanceOf(address(owner)), 0);
        escrow.create_lock(10 * TOKEN_1, lockDuration);


        escrow.create_lock(TOKEN_1, lockDuration);
        escrow.create_lock(TOKEN_1, lockDuration);
        assertEq(escrow.balanceOf(address(owner)), 3);
        console.log(escrow.delegates(owners[0]));
        console.log(escrow.getVotes(owners[0]));
        assertEq(escrow.getVotes(tempDelegate), 0);
        //We delegate to an external address here
        escrow.delegate(tempDelegate);

         // delegatee has the appropriate vote count
        console.log(escrow.getVotes(tempDelegate));

         // But each NFT still has it's own weight
        console.log(escrow.balanceOfNFT(1)); 
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One of the things that could be done is by using a similar logic from `VotingEscrow.sol#getVotes()` along with `isApprovedOrOwner()` to check the `checkpoints[account][ ].tokenIds`
