# DOS of withdrawals through filling the userPointHistory

## Summary
While not very feasible, it is technically possible to DOS withdraws associated with a tokenId, by doing a large amount of deposits for said tokenId.

## Vulnerability Detail
Unlike Velodrome, every `_checkpoint` call with an associated tokenId writes a new userPoint:

```solidity
            uint user_epoch = user_point_epoch[_tokenId] + 1;

            user_point_epoch[_tokenId] = user_epoch;
            u_new.ts = block.timestamp;
            u_new.blk = block.number;
            user_point_history[_tokenId][user_epoch] = u_new;
```

This opens up the door to a DOS, as the number of possible user points is limited:

```solidity
mapping(uint => Point[1000000000]) public user_point_history;
```

Any user can invoke `_checkpoint` for any tokenId by using `deposit_for`.

Naturally 1 Billion is a very large number that somewhats limits the feasability and likelihood of this attack (but does not mean a billion transactions need to be made, as the deposits could be looped through a contract). Even though the impact could be categorized as a `permanent freeze`, the limitations do not justify a higher severity than medium imo, hence `griefing` seems to be the appropriate impact.

## Impact
DOS of any tokenId, but associated with very high costs of attack.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider going back to Velodromes approach of accounting, which limits the addition of points to 1 per block:

```solidity
uint256 user_epoch = user_point_epoch[_tokenId];
if (user_epoch != 0 && user_point_history[_tokenId][user_epoch].ts == block.timestamp) {
    user_point_history[_tokenId][user_epoch] = u_new;
} else {
    user_point_epoch[_tokenId] = ++user_epoch;
    user_point_history[_tokenId][user_epoch] = u_new;
}
```

This would also add a time constraint on the attack, which would require 380 years, assuming a block is 12 seconds.
