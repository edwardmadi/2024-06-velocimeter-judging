# Incorrect assigning of lock duration for an LpDiscount

## Summary
A vulnerability has been identified in the `getLockDurationForLpDiscount` function where the logic incorrectly assigns the lock duration for an LP discount of zero. This can result in incorrect duration calculations and potential issues in the contract's operation.

## Vulnerability Detail
 The two variables below are used to lock the LP for certain periods.
 `uint256 public lockDurationForMaxLpDiscount = FULL_LOCK;` // 52 weeks // 31,449,600
`uint256 public lockDurationForMinLpDiscount = 7 * 86400;`  // 1 week // 604,800

The function `getLockDurationForLpDiscount` is a function designed to calculate the lock duration based on a provided discount, If the discount is zero, the function is meant to assign `lockDurationForMinLpDiscount` which is the minimum Lp discount. However, it is currently being assigned `lockDurationForMaxLpDiscount`. This miss alignment can lead to great impacts during calculations of the lock duration period which could affect the protocol in it entirety.

It is not right lock an LP with 0 discount for such a long period of time up to a year.

## Impact
This can disrupt the expected behavior of the contract, potentially causing user dissatisfaction and trust issues. Users might be subjected to longer lock periods than anticipated, leading to a lack of liquidity and potential financial losses.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function getLockDurationForLpDiscount(
    uint256 _discount
) public view returns (uint256 duration) {
    (int256 slope, int256 intercept) = getSlopeInterceptForLpDiscount();
    duration = _discount == 0 ? lockDurationForMaxLpDiscount : SignedMath.abs(slope * int256(_discount) + intercept); 
    // @audit if _discount == 0, lockDurationForMinLpDiscount should be used, which is 1 week and not lockDurationForMaxLpDiscount
}
```

## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the conditional check to implement the proper lock duration.

```diff
function getLockDurationForLpDiscount(
    uint256 _discount
) public view returns (uint256 duration) {
    (int256 slope, int256 intercept) = getSlopeInterceptForLpDiscount();
-    duration = _discount == 0 ? lockDurationForMaxLpDiscount : SignedMath.abs(slope * int256(_discount) + intercept); 
+    duration = _discount == 0 ? lockDurationForMinLpDiscount : SignedMath.abs(slope * int256(_discount) + intercept); 
    // @audit if _discount == 0, lockDurationForMinLpDiscount should be used, which is 1 week and not lockDurationForMaxLpDiscount
}
```

```solidity
duration = _discount == 0 ? lockDurationForMinLpDiscount : SignedMath.abs(slope * int256(_discount) + intercept);
```
