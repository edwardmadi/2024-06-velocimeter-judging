# Division by 0 in the `Voter.notifyRewardAmount()` will lead to loss of funds for the Velocimeter team.

## Summary

In the `Voter.notifyRewardAmount()` function, a division by 0 occurs if there are no votes in the system. This prevents the Velocimeter team from claiming its weekly emissions, leading to a loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue arises when there are no votes in the Voter system, causing `totalWeight` to be 0. This results in a division by 0 and a subsequent revert in the `notifyRewardAmount()` function:

```solidity
File: Voter.sol
485:     function notifyRewardAmount(uint amount) external {
             ...
490:         uint256 _ratio = amount * 1e18 / totalWeight; // <=== division by 0
             ...
495:     }
```

While it may seem logical that there should be no rewards for Gauges with no votes, this also prevents the team from claiming its weekly emissions, resulting in a loss of funds for the team:

```solidity
File: Minter.sol
112:     function update_period() external returns (uint) { // @audit-ok
                 ...
127:             require(_flow.transfer(teamEmissions, _teamEmissions)); // <=== team emission will be lost
                 ...
132:             _voter.notifyRewardAmount(weekly); // <=== when this reverts from division by 0
```

## Impact

Loss of funds for the team due to the inability to claim weekly emissions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the `notifyRewardAmount()` function handles cases where `totalWeight` is 0, allowing the team to claim its emissions correctly. One possible solution is to add a conditional check:

```solidity
File: Voter.sol
485:     function notifyRewardAmount(uint amount) external {
             ...
490:         uint256 _ratio = totalWeight > 0 ? amount * 1e18 / totalWeight : 0;
             ...
495:     }
```

Additionally, handle the team emissions separately if there are no votes to ensure they are distributed correctly.
