# Killed gauges brick parts of future token emissions

## Summary
Killed gauges brick parts of future token emissions

## Vulnerability Detail
When a gauge is killed, its weight is still accounted for in the `totalWeight`. This means that when distributed weekly emissions, a part of them will remain permanently locked within the contract as `totalWeight`'s value will be higher than the sum of the weights of all gauges which can claim emissions.

```solidity
    function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugePauseAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Pause gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");
        isAlive[_gauge] = false;
        claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        address _pair = IGauge(_gauge).stake(); // TODO: add test cases
        try IPair(_pair).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}
        emit GaugePaused(_gauge);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When pausing/killing a gauge, remove its weight from the `totalWeight` When a user resets a vote from a gauge, check if the gauge is killed and if it is, do not decrease the `totalWeight`.
