# Wrong totalWeight in Voter.sol

## Summary
If the user proceeds with the vote only once and does nothing afterwards, the voting power of the user does not decrease and this affects the overall voting result.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == minter,"not a minter");
        activeGaugeNumber = 0;
        currentEpochRewardAmount = amount;
        _safeTransferFrom(base, msg.sender, address(this), amount); // transfer the distro in
        uint256 _ratio = amount * 1e18 / totalWeight; // 1e18 adjustment is removed during claim
        if (_ratio > 0) {
            index += _ratio;
        }
        emit NotifyReward(msg.sender, base, amount);
    }
```

```solidity
   function _updateFor(address _gauge) internal {
        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];
        uint256 _supplied = weights[_pool];
        if (_supplied > 0) {
            uint _supplyIndex = supplyIndex[_gauge];
            uint _index = index; // get global index0 for accumulated distro
            supplyIndex[_gauge] = _index; // update _gauge current position to global position
            uint _delta = _index - _supplyIndex; // see if there is any difference that need to be accrued
            if (_delta > 0) {
                uint _share = uint(_supplied) * _delta / 1e18; // add accrued difference for each supplied token
                if (isAlive[_gauge]) {
                    claimable[_gauge] += _share;
                }
            }
        } else {
            supplyIndex[_gauge] = index; // new users are set to the default global state
        }
    }
```

In this protocol, votingPower linearly decreases over time. However, if no action for the tokenId is taken after the first vote, the votingPower of that token remains within totalWeight and weights. This directly affects _ratio within the Voter.notifyRewardAmount function. It also impacts claimable in the Voter._updateFor function.

When the Voter.distribute function is called, newly minted tokens are distributed to each gauge according to the voting results.

Ultimately, the voting results differ from what was intended, which affects the distribution of ALCX tokens.

Even if a token expires, this phenomenon continues.

## Impact
The governance voting results are manipulated, leading to a direct deviation from the intended impact of the original results.
