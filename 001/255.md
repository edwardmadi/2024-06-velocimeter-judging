# Claimable gauge distributions are bricked when `killGaugeTotally` is called

## Summary
Claimable gauge distributions are bricked when function `killGaugeTotally` is called.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a gauge is killed, `claimable[_gauge]` is deleted without being redistributed or transferred. As rewards received by the Voter contract are indexed and distributed in proportion to each pool's weight, this claimable amount is
permanently locked within the contract.

## Impact
See above

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider redistributing or transferring the `claimable` amount (e.g. to the `Minter`) before deleting the value.
