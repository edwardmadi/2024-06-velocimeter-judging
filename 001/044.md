# Overflow in result of `_poolWeight`.

Medium

## Summary

Overflow in uint256 result of _poolWeight variable.

## Vulnerability Detail

If _weights receives an array with a very large number, in a uint256.max scenario, and _weight (balanceOf the tokenId) also has a very large value. The calculation may overflow.

## Impact

To call the `Voter::vote` function you must have locked the `VotingEscrow::create_lock` function, passing some value greater than zero, this value is then stored in `_weight` and used to do the multiplication in `uint256 _poolWeight = _weights[i] * _weight / _totalVoteWeight;`

Foundry Test
```javascript
function createLock() public {
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), 5e17);
        escrow.create_lock(5e17, FIFTY_TWO_WEEKS);
        vm.roll(block.number + 1); // fwd 1 block because escrow.balanceOfNFT() returns 0 in same block
        assertGt(escrow.balanceOfNFT(1), 495063075414519385);
        assertEq(flowDaiPair.balanceOf(address(escrow)), 5e17);
    }

function testOverflowss() public {
    createLock(); 
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);

    voter.createGauge(address(pair), 0);

    address[] memory gaugeAddresses = new address[](1);
    gaugeAddresses[0] = address(pair);
   

    uint256[] memory gaugeWeights = new uint256[](1);
    gaugeWeights[0] = type(uint256).max;   

    voter.vote(1, gaugeAddresses, gaugeWeights);
    uint256 totalWeight = voter.totalWeight();
    console.log("Total Weight: ", totalWeight); 
}
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Perhaps it would be better to scale to try to make these calculations
