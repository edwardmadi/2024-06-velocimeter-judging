# `killGaugeTotally()` disrupts `_reset()` for newEpoch votes

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The [killGaugeTotally()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L407-L429) function is used to completely remove a gauge from the contract by the emergency council. However, once a gauge has been killed, it causes DOS for every `tokenID` that has used that pool in the previous epochs. 
This is due to an omitted check during the `_reset()` function:

```solidity
File: Voter.sol

    function _vote(uint _tokenId, address[] memory _poolVote, uint256[] memory _weights) internal {
        _reset(_tokenId);
```

In the reset function, the bribe contract is called directly without checks, causing the reset call to revert because
 `gauges[_pool] == address(0)` :

```solidity
File: Voter.sol

      IBribe(external_bribes[gauges[_pool]])._withdraw(uint256(_votes), _tokenId);

```

## Impact
- All users who have locked their veNFTs and voted using that pool will not be able to vote anymore
- They cannot call `reset()` either, so they can not withdraw their fund from `VotingEscrow.sol` forever. 

## Code Snippet

Here is a coded POC to demonstrate the issue, Kindly paste the function in the KillGauges.t.sol:

```solidity

  function testKillEffects() public {
    address gaugeAddress = address(gauge);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);
    
    address[] memory pools = new address[](1);
    pools[0] = address(pair);
    uint256[] memory weights = new uint256[](1);
    weights[0] = 100;
   
    voter.vote(1, pools, weights);
 
    voter.killGaugeTotally(gaugeAddress);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 2 weeks);
   
 
   
    voter.vote(1, pools, weights);
  }

```




## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

An appropriate fix would be to check if the `gauges[_pool] ` is set in the `_reset()` function:

```diff

        for (uint i = 0; i < _poolVoteCnt; i ++) {
            address _pool = _poolVote[i];
            uint256 _votes = votes[_tokenId][_pool];

-            if (_votes != 0) {
+           if (_votes != 0 && external_bribes[gauges[_pool]] != address(0) ) {
                _updateFor(gauges[_pool]);
                weights[_pool] -= _votes;
                votes[_tokenId][_pool] -= _votes;
                if (_votes > 0) {
                    IBribe(external_bribes[gauges[_pool]])._withdraw(uint256(_votes), _tokenId);
                    _totalWeight += _votes;
                } else {
                    _totalWeight -= _votes;
                }
                emit Abstained(_tokenId, _votes);
            }
        }

```
