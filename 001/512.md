# Claimable gauge distributions are locked when `Voter::killGaugeTotally` or `Voter::pauseGauge` is called

## Summary 

When a gauge is killed or paused `claimable[gauge]` is also cleared, since all rewards received by the `Voter` contract are distributed in propotion to each pool's weight, the cleared claimable amount will get permanently locked within the contract.


## Vulnerability Details


The way a gauge gets paused/killed is by calling  `Voter::killGaugeTotally`, `Voter::pauseGauge`:

```solidity
  function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugePauseAllowance(
                    msg.sender,
                    _gauge
                ),
                "Pause gauge not allowed"
            );
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");
        isAlive[_gauge] = false;

        //@review - Accrued rewards will get stuck in the contract
        claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        address _pair = IGauge(_gauge).stake(); // TODO: add test cases
        try IPair(_pair).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}
        emit GaugePaused(_gauge);
    }
```

```solidity
    function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugeKillAllowance(
                    msg.sender,
                    _gauge
                ),
                "Restart gauge not allowed"
            );
        }

        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");

        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];

        delete isAlive[_gauge];
        delete external_bribes[_gauge];
        delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
        delete isGauge[_gauge];
@>      delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

        killedGauges.push(_gauge);

        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }
```


As we can see from the snippet above in both cases claimable[_gauge] is set to 0. Which will leave the accrued rewards stucked in the contract. 


## Impact
Accrued rewards from a paused gauge, will get stuck in the contract.

## Recommendation

When a gauge gets paused or killed consider sending the cleared `claimable[gauge]` back to the `Minter` contract
