# The rewards will be stuck in the Voter contract and cannot be claimed

## Summary

When a Gauge is paused, any rewards sent from the Minter will be unclaimable and will be permanently stuck in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a `Gauge` is paused, `isAlive[gauge]` is set to false. If the minter calls `notifyRewardAmount` at this time, it will update the `index` and also call `updateGauge`. Due to the following check, the paused gauge will cause `claimable` not to be updated.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L527-L529

Therefore, when `distribute` is called, the gauge will not be able to claim rewards, and the rewards belonging to the gauge will be stuck in the contract.

This situation generally occurs when a vulnerability is discovered (for example, in an old version of a gauge or pool) or when a gauge is migrated.

Additionally, if users do not reallocate their votes, the gauge will still be allocated Flow tokens, but these tokens will not be sent to the gauge.

Note that `Minter.update_period` and `Voter.update*` can be called by anyone. Therefore, if there is a malicious user, they can, during a pause, use front-running or other methods to call `Minter.update_period` and then call `Voter.updateGauge`, causing the rewards to be stuck in the contract.
Additionally, the pause can happen at any time, such as just one second before the next `update_period` call.

### Minter.t.sol

```solidity
    function testHackPause() public {
        initializeVotingEscrow();

        FLOW.approve(address(router), TOKEN_1);
        FRAX.approve(address(router), TOKEN_1);
        router.addLiquidity(address(FRAX), address(FLOW), false, TOKEN_1, TOKEN_1, 0, 0, address(owner), block.timestamp);
        address pair1 = router.pairFor(address(FRAX), address(FLOW), false);
        address pair2 = router.pairFor(address(DAI), address(FLOW), false);

        address gauge = voter.createGauge(pair2, 0);

        address[] memory pools = new address[](2);
        pools[0] = pair1;
        pools[1] = pair2;
        uint256[] memory weights = new uint256[](2);
        weights[0] = 9899;
        weights[1] = 101;
        voter.vote(1, pools, weights);

        console.log("Before voter flow balanceOf:%d", IERC20(escrow.baseToken()).balanceOf(address(voter)));
        console.log("Before gauge flow balanceOf:%d", IERC20(escrow.baseToken()).balanceOf(address(gauge)));
        voter.pauseGauge(gauge);
        voter.distribute();
        console.log("After voter flow balanceOf:%d", IERC20(escrow.baseToken()).balanceOf(address(voter)));
        console.log("After gauge flow balanceOf:%d", IERC20(escrow.baseToken()).balanceOf(address(gauge)));
        voter.restartGauge(gauge);
        _elapseOneWeek();
        voter.distribute();
        console.log("Final voter flow balanceOf:%d", IERC20(escrow.baseToken()).balanceOf(address(voter)));
        console.log("Final gauge flow balanceOf:%d", IERC20(escrow.baseToken()).balanceOf(address(gauge)));
    }
```

## Impact

The funds will be permanently stuck in the voter contract and cannot be withdrawn.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When the gauge is paused, consideration should be given to redirecting its rewards to other active gauges, rather than not distributing any rewards at all. Alternatively, paused gauges should still be able to receive rewards.
