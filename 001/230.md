## Summary
When the gauge is killed or paused, this could lead to a situation where the claimable gauge distributions are locked or lost

## Vulnerability Detail
The `killGaugeTotally` function clears various mappings and states related to a gauge but does not handle the claimable rewards associated with the gauge. When a gauge is killed or paused, the `claimable[_gauge]` value is simply deleted, which can lead to the following issues:

Loss of Claimable Rewards: If there are rewards in `claimable[_gauge]` when `killGaugeTotally` is called, these rewards are lost because they are deleted without being redistributed or managed. Malicious actors might exploit this by pausing gauges at strategic times to prevent legitimate claimants from accessing their rewards.

additionally when pausing the gauge `pauseGauge` is called which sets the `claimable[_gauge] = 0`

Proof of Concept
Vulnerability Description
The `killGaugeTotally` function deletes the `claimable[_gauge]`without addressing the rewards associated with the gauge. As a result, any rewards that could have been claimed are lost.


```javascript
 function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugeKillAllowance(
                    msg.sender,
                    _gauge
                ),
                "Restart gauge not allowed"
            );
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");

        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];

        delete isAlive[_gauge];
        delete external_bribes[_gauge];
        delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
        delete isGauge[_gauge];
        delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

        killedGauges.push(_gauge);

        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }
```

## Impact
Rewards could be lost when the gauge is killed or paused

## Code Snippet
```javascript
 function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugeKillAllowance(
                    msg.sender,
                    _gauge
                ),
                "Restart gauge not allowed"
            );
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");

        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];

        delete isAlive[_gauge];
        delete external_bribes[_gauge];
        delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
        delete isGauge[_gauge];
        delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

        killedGauges.push(_gauge);

        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }
```

```javascript
function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugePauseAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Pause gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");
        isAlive[_gauge] = false;
        claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        address _pair = IGauge(_gauge).stake(); // TODO: add test cases
        try IPair(_pair).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}
        emit GaugePaused(_gauge);
    }
```

## Additionally
The `_updateFor` function does not manage claimable rewards for inactive gauges, which can lead to a loss of accrued rewards. It is possible that a gauge is killed at a time when a voting period has been updated but the reward amounts have not been distributed yet. This is possible because updating the period and distributing the respective rewards to the gauges require two separate actions `period_update` and rewards `distribute`. Inactive gauges will have rewards, but these rewards will be stuck in the claimable[_gauge] mapping without any mechanism to manage or redistribute them. This oversight could result in financial losses or inefficiencies, as rewards for inactive gauges will not be returned to the Minter contract, leading to potential exploits or unintended financial impacts.

```javascript
function _updateFor(address _gauge) internal {
    address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];
    uint256 _supplied = weights[_pool];
    if (_supplied > 0) {
        uint _supplyIndex = supplyIndex[_gauge];
        uint _index = index; // get global index for accumulated distribution
        supplyIndex[_gauge] = _index; // update _gauge current position to global position
        uint _delta = _index - _supplyIndex; // see if there is any difference that needs to be accrued
        if (_delta > 0) {
            uint _share = (uint(_supplied) * _delta) / 1e18; // add accrued difference for each supplied token
            if (isAlive[_gauge]) {
                claimable[_gauge] += _share;
            }
        }
    } else {
        supplyIndex[_gauge] = index; // new users are set to the default global state
    }
}
```
Here, rewards are only updated for active gauges. If a gauge is inactive, the _share amount is not redistributed, which can lead to rewards being lost.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before deleting `claimable[_gauge]` , redistribute the rewards to the Minter contract. It is important to note that
votes will continue to persist on the killed gauge, so it may also make sense to wipe these votes too. Otherwise,
the killed gauge will continue to accrue rewards from the Minter contract.

below is how it could be adjusted

```javascript
if (_claimable > 0) {
 @>>>>>     //transfer to minter token logic;

            delete claimable[_gauge];
        }
```
Also

modify the `_updateFor` function to include logic for transferring rewards to the Minter contract if the gauge is inactive.

```javascript
if (_delta > 0) {
            uint256 _share = (_supplied * _delta) / 1e18; 
            if (isAlive[_gauge]) {
                claimable[_gauge] += _share;
            } else {
  @>>>          // send rewards back to Minter so they're not stuck in Voter
            }
        }
    } else {
        supplyIndex[_gauge] = index;
    }
```
