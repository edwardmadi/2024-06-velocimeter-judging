# Loss of Claimable Rewards in Gauge Pausing and Killing

## Summary
The `pauseGauge` and `killGaugeTotally` functions in the Voter contract reset the claimable amount for a gauge to zero without transferring these funds back to the minter or distributing them. This leads to a permanent loss of these rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
In both pauseGauge and killGaugeTotally functions, the claimable amount for the gauge is set to zero:
```solidity
function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
    // ...
    claimable[_gauge] = 0;
    // ...
}

function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
    // ...
    delete claimable[_gauge];
    // ...
}
```
However, these functions do not transfer the claimable amount anywhere. As a result, these rewards are effectively lost, reducing the total amount of rewards that can be distributed to users.


## Impact
This vulnerability leads to a direct loss of rewards that were meant to be distributed to users. The impact increases with the frequency of gauge pausing or killing, and with the amount of rewards that were claimable at the time of these actions. This could result in:

* Loss of user funds (in the form of unclaimed rewards)
* Reduction in the overall reward pool
* Imbalance in the reward distribution system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In both pauseGauge and killGaugeTotally functions, transfer the claimable amount back to the minter before resetting it to zero. This ensures that these rewards can be redistributed.
```solidity
function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
    // ...
    uint256 _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
    if (_claimable > 0) {
        claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        IERC20(base).transfer(minter, _claimable);
    }
    // ...
}

function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
    // ...
    uint256 _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
    if (_claimable > 0) {
        delete claimable[_gauge];
        IERC20(base).transfer(minter, _claimable);
    }
    // ...
}
```
