# Killed gauge block user's vote resets

## Summary
File: [`Voter.sol`]

The `killGaugeTotally(...)` function blocks the `reset` function for tokens that voted for a gauge that has been subsequently killed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `killGaugeTotally(...)` function is used to completely delete a gauge and remove all mappings related to the bribes and pools connected with this gauge.

A problem arises when a user has voted with their token for this gauge and the gauge is later killed. In this case, the user cannot reset their votes for that token because the `_reset(...)` function attempts to interact with an external bribe connected to that gauge and call `_withdraw(...)`. If the gauge has been killed, this interaction fails (as the `external_bribes` is empty for that gauge), locking the user's token as its votes cannot be reset.

```solidity
if (_votes != 0) {
    _updateFor(gauges[_pool]);
    weights[_pool] -= _votes;
    votes[_tokenId][_pool] -= _votes;
    if (_votes > 0) {
        console.log("Bribe interaction");
        IBribe(external_bribes[gauges[_pool]])._withdraw(uint256(_votes), _tokenId); // @audit-issue Here it will revert if the gauge was killed
        _totalWeight += _votes;
    } else {
        _totalWeight -= _votes;
    }
    emit Abstained(_tokenId, _votes);
}
```

## Impact
A token is locked as its votes cannot be reset when the gauge is killed. Therefore, the stuck of funds is one result as the user can never withdraw.

## Recommendation
Consider clearing all votes for the `gauge` before it is killed, as IOTA EVM gas is inexpensive.
