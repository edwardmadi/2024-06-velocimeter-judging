# When killGauge and pauseGauge is called, claimable gauge distributions are locked permanently

## Summary
The `claimable[_gauge]` key value is cleared when a gauge is killed. Any rewards received by the Voter contract are indexed and distributed according to each pool's weight, so this claimable amount becomes permanently locked within the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The total amount of claimable tokens are indefinitely locked in the contract. In the case of suspicious activities, Velocimiter can pause or kill the Gauge, to prevent rewards to be claimed. The core issue is the rewards claimable will be stuck in the voter contract.
```solidity
    function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
    -- SNIP --
        delete claimable[_gauge]; //@audit result in lost of tokens cleared
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

        killedGauges.push(_gauge);

        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }
```
```solidity
    function getReward(address account, address[] memory tokens) external lock {
        require(msg.sender == account || msg.sender == voter);
        _unlocked = 1;
        IVoter(voter).distribute(address(this)); // Call distribute in voter.sol
```
Same issue lies in pauseGauge. Furthermore in pauseGauge is that epoch claimable[_gauge] resets back to 0, and the claimable amount of that period when `restartGauge` is called, it should add back the missing `claimable[_gauge]`. This was not added too.
```solidity
    function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugePauseAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Pause gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");
        isAlive[_gauge] = false;
        claimable[_gauge] = 0; //@audit
        address _pair = IGauge(_gauge).stake(); // TODO: add test cases
        try IPair(_pair).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}
        emit GaugePaused(_gauge);
    }
```
## Impact
Tokens are permanently stuck in voter

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Protocol should transfer rewards back to either Minter or Treasury
```diff
    function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
    -- SNIP --
-        delete claimable[_gauge];
+                // Return claimable back to minter
+        uint256 _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
+        if (_claimable > 0) {
+            IERC20(base).safeTransfer(minter, _claimable);
+            delete claimable[_gauge];
+        }
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

        killedGauges.push(_gauge);

        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }
```
Either update logic to keep the temporary claimable rewards, or send whole claimable rewards to minter and users are ineligible to claim rewards for that epoch.
```diff
    function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugePauseAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Pause gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");
        isAlive[_gauge] = false;
--      claimable[_gauge] = 0; 
+        if (_claimable > 0) {
+          IERC20(base).safeTransfer(minter, _claimable);
+         claimable[_gauge] = 0; 
+        }
        address _pair = IGauge(_gauge).stake(); // TODO: add test cases
        try IPair(_pair).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}
        emit GaugePaused(_gauge);
    }
```
