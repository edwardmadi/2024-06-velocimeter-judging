# Pausing and resetting do not update the gauge reward index

## Summary
File: [`Voter.sol`]

The `pauseGauge(...)` and `restartGauge(...)` functions clear the `claimable[_gauge]` mapping, but they do not update the reward `index`, leading to a situation where rewards can be distributed once the gauge is restarted.

## Vulnerability Detail
Every gauge has its `supplyIndex`, which stores an index of the rewards it has received, similar to `rewardPerTokenCheckpoint`. When `_updateFor(...)` is called, this index is updated and all rewards are added to the `claimable[_gauge]` mapping, which can be distributed later. The number of rewards is based on the number of votes connected with a specific gauge.

The problem arises when the gauge is paused, as its `supplyIndex` is not updated. Once the gauge is restarted, it can re-allocate rewards for the period it was paused if there were still some votes for that gauge from the past epoch.

## Impact
The gauge can still accrue rewards when it is paused and then restarted for the period it was paused. This is because the `weights` are not updated and there is no guarantee that the `updateFor(...)` function will run during this paused period to update its `supplyIndex`.

Note: *The index should be updated also before pausing and these rewards are sent to the minter, related to one of my findings but added here too.*

## Code Snippet
[No `updateFor(...)` inside `restartGauge(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L394-L405)

## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider updating the gauge index via `updateFor(...)` inside the `restartGauge(...)` function to ensure that the gauge will not receive rewards for the period it was paused.
