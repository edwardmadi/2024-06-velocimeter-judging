# Emergency Council will permanently lock user rewards when killing gauges via `Voter::killGaugeTotally`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Voter.sol` contract is responsible for managing gauges, distributing rewards, and handling voting mechanisms. It interacts with various components of the system, including gauges, bribes, and the voting escrow contract.

A critical function in this contract is [`killGaugeTotally()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L407-L429), which is designed to completely remove a gauge from the system. This function is called by the Emergency Council when a gauge needs to be terminated:

```solidity
function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
    // ... authorization checks ...
    delete isAlive[_gauge];
    delete external_bribes[_gauge];
    delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
    delete isGauge[_gauge];
    delete claimable[_gauge];
    delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
    delete gauges[_pool];
    // ... other operations ...
}
```

The issue lies in the deletion of `claimable[_gauge]` without first distributing these rewards to users or returning them to the system. This action permanently locks any accrued but unclaimed rewards in the contract, making them irretrievable.

Additionally, the [`_updateFor()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L517-L534) function, which is responsible for updating reward accruals, doesn't properly handle killed gauges:

```solidity
function _updateFor(address _gauge) internal {
    // ... calculations ...
    if (_delta > 0) {
        uint _share = uint(_supplied) * _delta / 1e18;
        if (isAlive[_gauge]) {
            claimable[_gauge] += _share;
        }
    }
    // ... other operations ...
}
```

This function continues to calculate shares for killed gauges but doesn't accrue them anywhere, effectively discarding potential rewards.

## Impact
When the Emergency Council kills a gauge, all users with unclaimed rewards in that gauge will permanently lose access to those rewards. This results in a direct financial loss for affected users, undermining trust in the protocol and potentially leading to significant user dissatisfaction.

Furthermore, the protocol continues to allocate rewards to killed gauges, which are effectively burned. This reduces the overall rewards available to active participants in the system, distorting the intended reward distribution mechanism.

The severity of this issue increases with the frequency of gauge removals and the amount of unclaimed rewards at the time of removal. In a worst-case scenario, if a major gauge with substantial unclaimed rewards is killed, it could result in a significant loss of value for many users and a considerable reduction in the total rewards distributed by the protocol.

## Proof of Concept
1. Alice stakes 1000 tokens in GaugeA and accrues 100 reward tokens over a week.
2. Before Alice claims her rewards, the Emergency Council detects an issue with GaugeA and calls `killGaugeTotally(GaugeA)`.
3. The `claimable[GaugeA]` mapping is deleted, permanently locking Alice's 100 reward tokens in the contract.
4. Alice attempts to claim her rewards but finds that they are no longer accessible.
5. In the next reward distribution cycle, the `_updateFor()` function calculates shares for the now-dead GaugeA, but these rewards are not accrued anywhere, effectively burning them.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendation
To address this critical issue, implement the following changes:

1. Modify the `killGaugeTotally()` function to distribute remaining claimable rewards before deleting the gauge data:

```diff
function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
    // ... existing checks ...
+   uint _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
+   if (_claimable > 0) {
+       IERC20(base).transfer(minter, _claimable);
+   }
    delete isAlive[_gauge];
    delete external_bribes[_gauge];
    delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
    delete isGauge[_gauge];
    delete claimable[_gauge];
    delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
    delete gauges[_pool];
    // ... remaining operations ...
}
```

2. Update the `_updateFor()` function to handle killed gauges:

```diff
function _updateFor(address _gauge) internal {
    // ... existing calculations ...
    if (_delta > 0) {
        uint _share = uint(_supplied) * _delta / 1e18;
        if (isAlive[_gauge]) {
            claimable[_gauge] += _share;
+       } else {
+           IERC20(base).transfer(minter, _share);
        }
    }
    // ... remaining operations ...
}
```

These changes ensure that accrued rewards are not lost when a gauge is killed and prevent the system from allocating rewards to non-existent gauges. The transferred rewards to the minter can then be redistributed or handled according to the protocol's governance decisions.
