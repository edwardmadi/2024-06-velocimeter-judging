# `notifyRewardAmount` Function will always revert if `totalWeight` is 0

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L490

## Summary
The notifyRewardAmount function lacks a check for when totalWeight is zero, which can lead to a division by zero error. This issue disrupts reward calculations and can potentially break the reward distribution mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail
The notifyRewardAmount function fails to handle the scenario where totalWeight is zero. Without a check for zero weight, the division operation performed in the function can lead to a division by zero error. This critical issue can cause incorrect reward calculations, disrupt the reward distribution mechanism, and potentially break the reward system.

Proof of Concept
In the current implementation of the notifyRewardAmount function, if totalWeight is zero, the following calculation will cause a division by zero error:

```javascript
uint256 _ratio = (amount * 1e18) / totalWeight; // totalWeight is zero
```
Here's a simplified example to illustrate this issue:

In this case, attempting to call `notifyRewardAmount` with a totalWeight of zero will cause the division operation to fail, leading to potential disruptions in the reward distribution system.

A similar issue was discovered in velodrome and fixed as below

## Impact
Without handling the zero weight scenario, the function's division operation will fail if totalWeight is zero, resulting in incorrect reward calculations and reverts.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
function notifyRewardAmount(uint amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == minter, "not a minter");
        activeGaugeNumber = 0;
        currentEpochRewardAmount = amount;
        _safeTransferFrom(base, msg.sender, address(this), amount); // transfer the distro in
        uint256 _ratio = (amount * 1e18) / totalWeight; // 1e18 adjustment is removed during claim
        if (_ratio > 0) {
            index += _ratio;
        }
        emit NotifyReward(msg.sender, base, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use a math library and also  make sure that totalWeight is never 0

```javascript
uint256 _ratio = (_amount * 1e18) / Math.max(totalWeight, 1); 
```
