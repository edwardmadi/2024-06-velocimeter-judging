# `Minter.sol` is using an outdated value of `activeGaugeNumber`

## Summary
The `Voter.sol#distribute()` function updates the [activeGaugeNumber](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L555-L557) too late. which will lead `Minter.sol#update_period()` to mint a wrong value of weekly emission  

## Vulnerability Detail
To easily understand this issue let's say we are in 1st epoch and a lot of veNFT `vote()` for different gauges so `totalWeight > 0`
Now, 1st epoch just end
Alice triggers `Minter.sol#update_period()` but will only mint the default value of `weeklyPerGauge` 
because the `activeGaugeNumber` is still empty.
 
So, the `voter.sol` will transfer the minted FLOW (which is only `weeklyPerGauge`)
and `distribute()` only distributes that small amount of FLOW.

Now, 2nd epoch just end
Alice trigger `Minter.sol#update_period()` will mint the result of `weeklyPerGauge * activeGaugeNumber`
However, the value of `activeGaugeNumber` is related to the 1st epoch

**Let's take this scenario (you can check the coded POC below):**
- Alice owned  veNFT_01
- Bob  owned  veNFT_02
nb: veNFT_01 and veNFT_02 have the same weight.
- Gauge_01 and Gauge_02

A- 1st epoch started:
Alice voted for Gauge_01 and Bob voted for Gauge_02

B- 1st epoch just ended/2nd epoch started:
call `distribute()` 
`activeGaugeNumber` now is `2`

Alice voted for Gauge_01
Bob called `reset()`
 
C- 2nd epoch just ended:
Alice trigger `Minter.sol#update_period()` will mint the result of `weeklyPerGauge * activeGaugeNumber` which will transfer weekly emission for two gauges

call `distribute()`  it will transfer all weekly emissions for two gauges to Gauge_01

Because the vote is weekly Minter should mint the FLOW and `notifyRewardAmount` immediately when the epoch ends, not after the next epoch ends. veNFT holders will change their vote which will prevent some gauges from receiving their emissions 

## Impact
- Gauges are losing their emissions in favor of other gauges due to using an outdated value of `activeGaugeNumber`
- The system of gauge emissions and vote is broken.

Please copy the following POC in `Minter.t.sol`
```solidity
function POC_initializeVotingEscrow() public {
        deployBase();

        FLOW.transfer(address(minter), TOKEN_100K);

        address[] memory pools = new address[](1);
        pools[0] = pair1;

        uint gauge1BalAfter = FLOW.balanceOf(gauge1);
        uint gauge2BalAfter = FLOW.balanceOf(gauge2);
        //gauge1 receives emission for two gauges (weeklyPerGauge * 2)
        console2.log(
            "weekly_emission for gauge1",
            gauge1BalAfter - gauge1BalBefore
        );
        //gauge2 receive 0
        console2.log(
            "weekly_emission for gauge2",

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I believe you should update `activeGaugeNumber` before `update_period()` mints the weekly emission
