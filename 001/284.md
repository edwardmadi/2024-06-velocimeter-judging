# Claimable gauge distributions are locked when `killGaugeTotally()` is called in the Voter

## Summary

The function `killGaugeTotally()` doesn't consider for the claimable gauge rewards

## Vulnerability Detail

When a gauge is killed, the `claimable[_gauge]` key value is cleared. This action results in any rewards associated with that gauge being permanently locked within the `Voter` contract. Normally, rewards received by the Voter contract are indexed and distributed proportionally to each pool's weight. However, when the `claimable[_gauge]` value is cleared, the rewards meant for that specific gauge cannot be accessed or redistributed, effectively making them inaccessible. This issue not only prevents users from claiming their rightful rewards but also results in those rewards being irretrievably locked within the contract, causing a permanent loss of value.

```Solidity
    function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugeKillAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Restart gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");

        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];

        delete isAlive[_gauge];
        delete external_bribes[_gauge];
        delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
        delete isGauge[_gauge];
        delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

        killedGauges.push(_gauge);

        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }
```

To resolve this, it is essential to implement a mechanism that ensures rewards for killed gauges are either redistributed to active gauges or returned to the reward pool. This adjustment will prevent the permanent locking of rewards and maintain the integrity and fairness of the reward distribution system.

## Impact

The corresponding rewards for a specific gauge cannot be accessed or redistributed, effectively making them inaccessible. This leads to loss of rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider returning the claimable amount to the Minter contract. It is important to note that votes will continue to persist on the killed gauge, so it may also make sense to wipe these votes too. Otherwise, the killed gauge will continue to accrue rewards from the Minter contract.

```diff
        delete isGauge[_gauge];
+       uint256 _claimable = claimable[_gauge];
+       if (_claimable > 0) {
+           IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(minter, _claimable);
+           delete claimable[_gauge];
+       }
```

or,

```diff
        if (isAlive[_gauge]) {
            claimable[_gauge] += _share;
        }
+       else {
+           IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(minter, _share);
+       }
