# Paused/killed gauges will loose their unclaimed reward

## Summary
When a gauge is paused, all the rewards it has accrued up until that point are lost. This is due to the implementation of the `killGaugeTotally(...)` and `pauseGauge(...)` functions respectively.

## Vulnerability Detail
The afore mentioned functions clear the accrued rewards of a gauge when they are paused or even killed as shown below, hence is a gauge has some unclaimed FLOW emissions prior to it's being paused or killed

```solidity
    function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
       ...

        delete isGauge[_gauge];
>>>>    delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        ....
        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }



    function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
        ...
        isAlive[_gauge] = false;
>>>>    claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        address _pair = IGauge(_gauge).stake(); // TODO: add test cases
        ...
    }
```

## Impact
This leads to loss of unclaimed emissions rewards for a gauge and by extension the voters in the gauge

## Recommendation

Consider modifying the `killGaugeTotally(...)`  and `pauseGauge(...)` functions as shown below

```diff
    function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
       ...

        delete isGauge[_gauge];
-       delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        ....
        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }



    function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
        ...
        isAlive[_gauge] = false;
-       claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        address _pair = IGauge(_gauge).stake(); // TODO: add test cases
        ...
    }

```
