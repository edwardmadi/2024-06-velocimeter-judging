# Users can front-run votes to gain extra voting power in `Voter::vote()`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Voter.sol` contract manages the voting process for gauge weights, which determines the distribution of rewards. The contract includes two key functions: `reset()` and `vote()`. 

The [`reset()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L201-L205) function allows users to remove their votes from a gauge:

```solidity
function reset(uint _tokenId) external onlyNewEpoch(_tokenId) {
    require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));
    _reset(_tokenId);
    IVotingEscrow(_ve).abstain(_tokenId);
}
```

The [`vote()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L287-L292) function enables users to cast votes for gauges:

```solidity
function vote(uint tokenId, address[] calldata _poolVote, uint256[] calldata _weights) external onlyNewEpoch(tokenId) {
    require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, tokenId));
    require(_poolVote.length == _weights.length);
    lastVoted[tokenId] = block.timestamp;
    _vote(tokenId, _poolVote, _weights);
}
```

The issue arises from the lack of protection against front-running in these functions. Users can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate gauge weights by resetting their votes before a weight change and re-voting after the change. This allows them to gain extra voting power, leading to an unfair distribution of rewards.

The highest impact scenario occurs when a user with significant voting power exploits this vulnerability during a major weight change, potentially skewing the reward distribution for an entire epoch.

## Impact
The issue allows users to artificially inflate their voting power, leading to an unfair distribution of rewards in the protocol.  The impact is particularly severe as it affects the core mechanism of reward distribution, potentially destabilizing the entire incentive structure of the protocol.

## Proof of Concept
1. Initial state:
   - User A has 10,000 votes on Gauge X
   - Gauge X has a total weight of 10,000

2. User A monitors the mempool and sees an incoming transaction to increase Gauge X's weight to 15,000

3. User A front-runs this transaction:
   - Calls `reset()` to remove their 10,000 votes from Gauge X
   - Gauge X's weight is now 0

4. The weight change transaction executes:
   - Gauge X's weight is set to 15,000

5. User A immediately calls `vote()`:
   - Votes 10,000 for Gauge X
   - Gauge X's weight is now 25,000 instead of the expected 15,000

6. User A has effectively gained 10,000 extra voting power

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, implement incremental methods to adjust weights rather than setting them directly. This can prevent users from manipulating the weight by front-running transactions. Here's a suggested change:

```diff
+ function incrementGaugeWeight(address _gauge, uint256 _amount) internal {
+     weights[_gauge] += _amount;
+ }

+ function decrementGaugeWeight(address _gauge, uint256 _amount) internal {
+     weights[_gauge] -= _amount;
+ }

function _vote(uint _tokenId, address[] memory _poolVote, uint256[] memory _weights) internal {
    // ... existing code ...

    for (uint i = 0; i < _poolCnt; i++) {
        // ... existing code ...

-       weights[_pool] += _poolWeight;
+       incrementGaugeWeight(_pool, _poolWeight);

        // ... rest of the function ...
    }
}
```

Additionally, consider implementing a cooldown period between resetting votes and voting again to further prevent manipulation attempts.
