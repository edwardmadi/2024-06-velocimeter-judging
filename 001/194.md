# Claimable gauge distributions are locked when `pauseGauge `is called

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
When a gauge is paused, the claimable[_gauge] key value is cleared. Because any rewards received
by the Voter contract are indexed and distributed in proportion to each pool's weight, this claimable amount is
permanently locked within the contract.

Consider returning the claimable amount to the Minter contract. It is important to note that
votes will continue to persist on the killed gauge, so it may also make sense to wipe these votes too. Otherwise,
the killed gauge will continue to accrue rewards from the Minter contract.
## Impact
The claimable rewards will be locked within the contract.

```solidity
   function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugePauseAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Pause gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");
        isAlive[_gauge] = false;
        claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        address _pair = IGauge(_gauge).stake(); // TODO: add test cases
        try IPair(_pair).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}
        emit GaugePaused(_gauge);
    }
