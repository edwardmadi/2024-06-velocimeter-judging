# Pausing a gauge results in all it's claimable funds becoming forever stuck

## Summary
Pausing a gauge results in all it's claimable funds becoming forever stuck

## Vulnerability Detail
When a gauge is paused, it's `claimable` value gets cleared.

```solidity
    function pauseGauge(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugePauseAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Pause gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");
        isAlive[_gauge] = false;
        claimable[_gauge] = 0;
        address _pair = IGauge(_gauge).stake(); // TODO: add test cases
        try IPair(_pair).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}
        emit GaugePaused(_gauge);
    }
```

Meaning that if the gauge had any any unclaimed funds, they'll remain within the Voter contract forever stuck.

## Impact
Permanently lost funds.
