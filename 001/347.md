# Voter contract's base token can be locked for ever

## Summary
Admin might decide to pause some gauges but in some scenarios this leading to lock base tokens in voter contract

## Vulnerability Detail
**Textual PoC:**
Let's assume we have two pools and every pool has its gauge, poolA has been voted by Alice with 1000 voting power and poolB has been voted by Bob with 1000 voting power in result:
* weight[poolA] = 1000
* weight[poolB] = 1000
* totalWeight = 2000
* numberOfActiveGauge = 0

`Voter::distribute` will be called in the end of first epoch[7 days] and new epoch will be started and emissions will be released,in result:
* index = 1e18
* claimble[poolA] = uint(_supplied) * _delta / 1e18 => 1000 * 1e18 / 1e18 = 1000
* claimble[poolB] = uint(_supplied) * _delta / 1e18 => 1000 * 1e18 / 1e18 = 1000
* weekly_emission = 2000
* numberOfActiveGauge = 2

Admin will decide to pause poolB'gauge but Bob doesn't reset his voting power in the duration of second epoch for any reason[he has gone to vacation] and just Alice revote on poolA[this isn't necessary],in the end of second epoch:
* weight[poolA] = weight[poolA] - oldweight + newweight = 1000 - 1000 + 1000 = 1000
* weight[poolB] = 1000
* totalWeight = 2000
* weekly_emission = 4000
* index = 2e18
* claimble[poolA] = delta * supplied / 1e18 = (2e18 - 1e18) * 1000 / 1e18 = 2000
* claimable[poolB] = 0 //because poolB's gauge isn't active
* 2000 FLOW remaing in voter contract

keeper calls `Voter::distribute` at the end of second epoch and index will be 2e18 its mean claimble will be reset to current ratio

to run this test u need add some lines to `Voter.t::deployVoter`
```solidity
