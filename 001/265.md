# Rewards for killed gauges will be stuck in Voter contract and will cause alive gauges to receive less rewards

## Summary
When calculating the `_ratio` in the Voter contract's `notifyRewardAmount()`, the `totalWeight` is used to calculate how much to increase the global supply index with. However, when a gauge is killed, it's voting power will not be deducted from the `totalWeight` and thus the supply index will come out a smaller value than it should be. As a result, the alive gauges will receive less rewards (proportional to the % of `totalWeight` that the weight of the killed gauge represents), and on top of that rewards sent to the Voter for that gauge will be stuck in there as the Voter doesn't send rewards to killed gauges and there is no tokens rescue functionality either.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a gauge is killed, its voting power will **not** be deducted from the `totalWeight` in the Voter contract. When the reward distribution takes place in the Voter contract, it receives rewards from the Minter and increments the `index` based on the `amount` received and the `totalWeight` across gauges.

```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == minter,"not a minter");
        activeGaugeNumber = 0;
        currentEpochRewardAmount = amount;
        _safeTransferFrom(base, msg.sender, address(this), amount); // transfer the distro in
â†’       uint256 _ratio = amount * 1e18 / totalWeight; // 1e18 adjustment is removed during claim
        if (_ratio > 0) {
            index += _ratio;
        }
        emit NotifyReward(msg.sender, base, amount);
    }
```

As we can see, nothing about a gauge's voting weight is done when it's killed:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L407-L429
```solidity
    function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugeKillAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Restart gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");

        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];

        delete isAlive[_gauge];
        delete external_bribes[_gauge];
        delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
        delete isGauge[_gauge];
        delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

        killedGauges.push(_gauge);

        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }
```
## Impact
As a result, the `index` will be incremented less than it should be as the `totalWeight` would still include the weight of the killed gauges and thus it'll cause the alive gauges to receive less rewards and the rewards for the killed gauges will be stuck in the Voter contract as it'll not distribute rewards to killed gauges (`_updateFor(gauge)` sets the gauge's claimable amount to 0 if killed).

Manual Review
## Recommendation
This one is tricky to fix as anything related to "wiping the gauge's weights" type of solution would involve storing the addresses that voted for that specific gauge and then iterating over all of them, resetting their votes for the specific gauge. This could be a costly operation and might introduce a griefing attack vector if not implemented carefully, on the other hand however it'll guarantee a fair distribution of rewards and will eliminate the stuck funds issue.
