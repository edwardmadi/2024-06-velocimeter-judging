# RewardDistributorV2 claims can be DoSed through excess amount of userPoint creation

## Summary
A malicious user can DoS (permanently lock) ve token owner's claims, by creating certain amount of user_point_history entries by calling VotingEscrow.deposit_for() on a target token multiple times.

## Vulnerability Details
`RewardsDistributorV2` claims are calculated in the `_claimable()` function. The calculation first involves finding the last `user_point` which was taken before the last `week_cursor`. This is done through a `for` loop that cycles from the last `user_epoch` until it finds one. The loop can cycle up to 50 times:
```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
```
hence if there are more `userPoints` than 50 the `_claimable()` function will return 0 as `toDistribute`. 

A malicious user can call the `VotingEscrow.depositFor()` on the attacked veALCX token multiple times and can deposit minimum amount tokens (1 wei is enough), this way he can create the `userPoints` that will DoS the function.

## Impact
ve token holder loses irreversibly all claims.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The solution would be to use binary search like in other places in the system.
