# Changing a gauge's external bribe will brick `veNFTs` as they'll attempt withdrawing from the new one.

## Summary
Changing a gauge's external bribe will brick `veNFTs` as they'll attempt withdrawing from the new one.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the `Voter` contract, admins can change a gauge's external bribe
```solidity
    function setExternalBribeFor(address _gauge, address _external) external onlyEmergencyCouncil {
        require(isGauge[_gauge]);
        _setExternalBribe(_gauge, _external);
    }

    function _setExternalBribe(address _gauge, address _external) private {
        external_bribes[_gauge] = _external;
        address pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];
        try IPair(pool).setExternalBribe(_external){} catch {}
        emit ExternalBribeSet(msg.sender, _gauge, _external);
    }
```

It must be noted that upon voting for a gauge/pool, a deposit is made into the current external bribe
```solidity
                poolVote[_tokenId].push(_pool);

                weights[_pool] += _poolWeight;
                votes[_tokenId][_pool] += _poolWeight;
                IBribe(external_bribes[_gauge])._deposit(uint256(_poolWeight), _tokenId);
```

By changing the external bribe, next time `_reset` is called, it will attempt to make a withdraw from the new external bribe
```solidity
                if (_votes > 0) {
                    IBribe(external_bribes[gauges[_pool]])._withdraw(uint256(_votes), _tokenId);
                    _totalWeight += _votes;
```

As the deposit has been made in the old one and now attempts to withdraw from the new one, it will fail.  As any calls to `_reset` will fail for said NFTs, they'll be DoS'd.
