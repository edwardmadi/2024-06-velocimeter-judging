# The veNFT owner is permanently unable to withdraw

## Summary
The VotingEcsrow.sol :: withdaraw() function contains a bug that will cause it always to revert leaving the token owner unable to withdraw permanently.

## Vulnerability Detail
In VotingEscrow.sol:
Every call to _isApprovedOrOwner extends max_lock for tokenId while it is invoked into functions that don't require or account for that behavior causing different implications. 
The most significant impact occurs in  withdraw() function:

```solidity
 function withdraw(uint _tokenId) external nonreentrant {
        assert(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));
        require(attachments[_tokenId] == 0 && !voted[_tokenId], "attached");

        LockedBalance memory _locked = locked[_tokenId];
        require(block.timestamp >= _locked.end, "The lock didn't expire");
       ...//omitted the rest of the function for simplicity.
    }
```
 As can be seen the function first invokes _isApprovedOrOwner() function to assert that the caller is indeed approved to make the action.
The problem is that, inside _isApprovedOrOwner()  max_lock() is called  - without any known reason - and it extends the token's unlock_time (the code is in the snippets section)  in the assert line,max_lock will cause the _locked.end to extend to " (block.timestamp + MAXTIME) / WEEK * WEEK" ,therefore the following require statement " require(block.timestamp >= _locked.end, "The lock didn't expire"); " will always revert leaving the tokenId owner unable to withdraw.

## Impact
The veNFT owners are not able to control their own tokens. This is bad for protocol functionality and also bad for user experience.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Omit max_lock()  from _isApprovedOrOwner()
```diff
function _isApprovedOrOwner(address _spender, uint _tokenId) internal returns (bool) {
     -   max_lock(_tokenId);
         ...
    }
```
