# Received NFT position in VotingEscrow may need more locking time than the receiver's expectation

## Summary
When one user receives one NFT, the NFT may be enabled `enable_max_lock`. Anyone can maximum the NFT position for the receiver. This is not new NFT's owner's expectation.

## Vulnerability Detail
In VotingEscrow, NFT owners can set their NFT to max lock via `enable_max_lock`. After that, anyone can extend the NFT's locking time to the maximum locking time. 
The vulnerability is that when the owner transfers the NFT position to the receiver, we don't disable the max lock.  The new receiver will expect to withdraw this NFT when the NFT's lock reaches the end. However, anyone can extend the lock to the maximum if the NFT's previous owner enables max lock. The new receiver has to lock the NFT for a much longer time than expected.

```javascript
    function enable_max_lock(uint _tokenId) external {
        assert(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));
        require(maxLockIdToIndex[_tokenId] == 0,"enabled");

        max_locked_nfts.push(_tokenId);
        maxLockIdToIndex[_tokenId] = max_locked_nfts.length;

        max_lock(_tokenId);
    }
    function _transferFrom(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint _tokenId,
        address _sender
    ) internal {
        ...
        // Clear approval. Throws if `_from` is not the current owner
        _clearApproval(_from, _tokenId);
        // Remove NFT. Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT
        _removeTokenFrom(_from, _tokenId);
        // auto re-delegate
        _moveTokenDelegates(delegates(_from), delegates(_to), _tokenId);
        // Add NFT
        _addTokenTo(_to, _tokenId);

        ownership_change[_tokenId] = block.number;

        //unlock split
        blockedSplit[_tokenId] = false;

        // Log the transfer
        emit Transfer(_from, _to, _tokenId);
    }
```

## Impact
The receiver has to lock the NFT for a much longer time than expected.
