# Expired max-lock veLP would lock owner rewards and Lp and disable deposits/withdrawals/transfers

## Summary

An expired max-locked veLP token would lock the holders rewards, Lp tokens and DOS deposits/withdrawals/transfers/merge/split etc. any function that requires approval.

## Vulnerability Detail

`_isApprovedOrOwner` relocks tokens with maxlock enabled as seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L295-L296 , the max_lock function, however, reverts if the the tokens lock has expired https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L918-L918.
Even though tokens with maxlock/auto re-lock are supposed to relock on interaction with the protocol, there's no guarantee that all maxlocked tokens will be active as tokens earn rewards based on voting power and not activity.
There's also no added benefit to preventing relock on a token that already opted-in to auto-relock even if the lock expires. 

## Impact

High, locked rewards and Lp and token becomes practically unusable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Auto-relock tokens should be able to relock even if the lock expires.
```diff

  function max_lock(uint _tokenId) public {
      if(maxLockIdToIndex[_tokenId] !=0 && max_lock_enabled) {
          LockedBalance memory _locked = locked[_tokenId];
          uint unlock_time = (block.timestamp + MAXTIME) / WEEK * WEEK; // Locktime is rounded down to weeks

          if(unlock_time > _locked.end) {
-             require(_locked.end > block.timestamp, 'Lock expired');
              require(_locked.amount > 0, 'Nothing is locked');
              require(unlock_time <= block.timestamp + MAXTIME, 'Voting lock can be 52 weeks max');

              _deposit_for(_tokenId, 0, unlock_time, _locked, DepositType.INCREASE_UNLOCK_TIME);
          }
      }
  }
```
