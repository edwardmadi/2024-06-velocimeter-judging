# Users who enable max lock will be forced to extend their lock end time whenever a permissioned function is called or approval is checked on the token

## Summary
The `VotingEscrow::_isApprovedOrOwner(...)` is called on a user's token to ensure only permissioned actions are called on the token. However, the implementation always extend the lock end time of users who have enabled `maxLockIdToIndex[_tokenId]` for their token forcing them to lock their tokens for longer than they intended by an additional 52 weeks from the point an approval is checked.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: VotingEscrow.sol
295:     function _isApprovedOrOwner(address _spender, uint _tokenId) internal returns (bool) {
296:  ->     max_lock(_tokenId);
297: 
298:         address tokenOwner = idToOwner[_tokenId];
299:         bool spenderIsOwner = tokenOwner == _spender;
300:         bool spenderIsApproved = _spender == idToApprovals[_tokenId];
301:         bool spenderIsApprovedForAll = (ownerToOperators[tokenOwner])[_spender];
302:         return spenderIsOwner || spenderIsApproved || spenderIsApprovedForAll;
303:     }

```

- Alice creates lock in the ve for 1WEEK  creating token 1
- she immediately enables max lock  for token 1 and her lock time is extended for one year
- After 40 weeks Alice delegates token 1 to Bob
- At the end of 60 weeks, Alice calls `withdraw (...)` with token 1 but the call reverts because
    - her lock time was extended when she delegated to bob extending it by an extra 52 weeks from the 40th week
- Now she is forced to hold her position

**CODED POC**

Add the test case below to the `VotingEscrow.t.sol` file and run `forge test --mt testWrongExtendWithLock -vv`

```solidity
    address alice = address(0x03);
    address bob = address(0x04);

        function testPunishWithLock() public {
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), TOKEN_1);
        uint256 lockDuration = 7 * 24 * 3600; // 1 week

        vm.warp(((block.timestamp / ONE_WEEK )* ONE_WEEK) + ONE_WEEK);


        // Balance should be zero before and 1 after creating the lock
        assertEq(escrow.balanceOf(address(owner)), 0);
        escrow.create_lock(TOKEN_1, lockDuration);
        assertEq(escrow.currentTokenId(), 1);
        assertEq(escrow.ownerOf(1), address(owner));
        assertEq(escrow.balanceOf(address(owner)), 1);


        // for demonstration purposes, give Alice lpTokens to create lock
        vm.prank(address(owner));
        flowDaiPair.transferFrom(address(owner), alice, 10e18);

        // alice lock lp in ve
        vm.startPrank(address(alice));
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), 10e18);
        uint aliceToken = escrow.create_lock(10e18, lockDuration);
        escrow.enable_max_lock(aliceToken); // alice enables max lock extending her lock time by additional 52 weeks
        vm.stopPrank();


        // Alice lock has almost ended
        vm.warp(((block.timestamp / ONE_WEEK ) * ONE_WEEK) + (40 * ONE_WEEK) - 100);
        // vm.assertTrue(escrow.max_lock_enabled(), true);

        
        vm.prank(alice);
        escrow.delegate(bob);

        // alice disables max before the end of her lock end
        vm.prank(address(alice));
        escrow.disable_max_lock(aliceToken);


        vm.warp(((block.timestamp / ONE_WEEK ) *  ONE_WEEK) + 20 * ONE_WEEK);

        // after about two weeks, alice calls 
        vm.startPrank(address(alice));
        vm.expectRevert("The lock didn't expire");
        escrow.withdraw(aliceToken);
        vm.stopPrank();

    }
```

## Impact
- Users are forced to lock their funds beyond their intended lock time
- withdrawals could revert locking tokens for up to an additional 52 weeks

## Recommendation
Modify the `_isApprovedOrOwner(...)` function as shown below


```diff
File: VotingEscrow.sol
295:     function _isApprovedOrOwner(address _spender, uint _tokenId) internal returns (bool) {
- 296:  ->     max_lock(_tokenId);
297: 
298:         address tokenOwner = idToOwner[_tokenId];
299:         bool spenderIsOwner = tokenOwner == _spender;
300:         bool spenderIsApproved = _spender == idToApprovals[_tokenId];
301:         bool spenderIsApprovedForAll = (ownerToOperators[tokenOwner])[_spender];
302:         return spenderIsOwner || spenderIsApproved || spenderIsApprovedForAll;
303:     }
