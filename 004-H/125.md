# Attacker can DoS users by delegating tokens at `MAX_DELEGATES` limit in `VotingEscrow::_moveTokenDelegates()`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `VotingEscrow` contract implements a delegation system where users can delegate their voting power to other addresses. This delegation is managed through an array-based system, where each delegate address maintains an array of token IDs that have been delegated to it. The contract uses a `MAX_DELEGATES` constant, set to `1024`, to limit the number of delegations an address can receive.

The delegation logic is primarily handled in the [`_moveTokenDelegates()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1362-L1411). This function is responsible for updating the delegation state when tokens are transferred or when a user changes their delegate. It manipulates arrays of token IDs, adding or removing them from the respective delegate's array.

The core issue lies in the implementation of `_moveTokenDelegates()`. As the number of delegated tokens approaches the [`MAX_DELEGATES`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1266) limit, operations involving these tokens become increasingly gas-intensive. This is because the function needs to iterate through and manipulate large arrays for each operation.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly delegating tokens to a target address until it reaches the `MAX_DELEGATES` limit. Once this limit is reached, any operation that involves moving tokens to or from this address (such as transfers, withdrawals, or minting) will require an excessive amount of gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit.

This vulnerability was previously identified in a similar type contract by Spearbit:

The relevant code snippet from the `VotingEscrow` contract:

```solidity
uint public constant MAX_DELEGATES = 1024; // avoid too much gas

function _moveTokenDelegates(
    address srcRep,
    address dstRep,
    uint _tokenId
) internal {
    if (srcRep != dstRep && _tokenId > 0) {
        if (srcRep != address(0)) {
            // ... code to remove token from srcRep's array ...
        }

        if (dstRep != address(0)) {
            // ... code to add token to dstRep's array ...
            require(
                dstRepOld.length + 1 <= MAX_DELEGATES,
                "dstRep would have too many tokenIds"
            );
            // ... more code to update dstRep's array ...
        }
    }
}
```

## Impact
This vulnerability can effectively lock users' tokens by making it prohibitively expensive or impossible to perform operations on them. Users attempting to transfer, withdraw, or mint tokens involving an address at the `MAX_DELEGATES` limit will find their transactions failing due to out-of-gas errors. This severely impacts the usability and functionality of the contract, potentially leading to significant financial losses for affected users.

## Proof of Concept
1. Attacker creates multiple accounts and obtains a large number of tokens.
2. Attacker identifies a target address (victim).
3. Attacker repeatedly calls the `delegate()` function, delegating tokens from their multiple accounts to the victim's address.
4. This process continues until the victim's address reaches the `MAX_DELEGATES` limit of 1024.
5. Now, when the victim or any other user attempts to transfer tokens to or from the victim's address, the transaction will fail due to excessive gas costs in the `_moveTokenDelegates()` function.
6. The victim's tokens are effectively locked, as they cannot be transferred or withdrawn.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendation
1. You guys can reduce the `MAX_DELEGATES` constant to a lower, more manageable number:

```diff
- uint public constant MAX_DELEGATES = 1024; // avoid too much gas
+ uint public constant MAX_DELEGATES = 128; // Reduced to prevent DoS attacks
```

2. Implement an opt-in/opt-out mechanism for receiving delegations:

```diff
+ mapping(address => bool) public optInDelegation;

+ function setOptInDelegation(bool _optIn) external {
+     optInDelegation[msg.sender] = _optIn;
+ }

function _moveTokenDelegates(
    address srcRep,
    address dstRep,
    uint _tokenId
) internal {
    // ... existing code ...

-   if (dstRep != address(0)) {
+   if (dstRep != address(0) && optInDelegation[dstRep]) {
        // ... existing code ...
    }
}
```

3. Consider reworking the delegation logic to use a more efficient data structure, such as a mapping instead of an array, to store delegated token IDs.
