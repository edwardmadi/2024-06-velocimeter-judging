# Withdrawals, deposits and transfers of tokens for a given user can be griefed by delegating them `MAX_DELEGATES` of tokens

## Summary
Anybody can lock a minimal amount and delegate to a given address multiple times (effectively spam them), bumping their gas costs way up for withdrawals, deposits and transfers and griefing them.

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker can deposit and mint up to 1024 veNFTs and delegate them to any account address, bumping their GAS costs for withdrawals, deposits and transfers of tokens to around 23M gas per transaction primarily due to how `_moveTokenDelegates()` works.

## Impact
Unsuspecting users can be forced to pay huge amounts of gas in order to withdraw their locked funds. Which can cost more than the actual locked amount and thus forcing the user to leave their funds locked forever due to it not being financially sensible to pay the gas cost to withdraw their funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Lower the `MAX_DELEGATES` number to at most a quarter of the current limit (1024) or allow users to opt-in to being delegated voting power to, while being opted-out by default to avoid such griefing attacks.
