# `create_lock(...)` can be DOS'd preventing users from creating lock in the `VotingEscrow`

## Summary
The `VotingEscrow::delegate(..)` function can be used to grief user and delegatees preventing
- users from creating lock for themselves
- other users from delegating to their desired delegatee 
- token owners cannot split their token because the new token from the split cannot be minted to them
leading to a denial of service for users.

I added two POCs for the two scenarios explained below


## Vulnerability Detail
This vulnerability exist because there is an assumption the transaction calls involving delegation [could exceed block gas limit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1266), however the IOTA network TANGLE implementation eliminates the concept of block gas limit

**SCENARIO 1**

- Alice creates lock in the `ve` with 5e18 lp token with intention of delegating to Max
- Bob creates 1023 locks with 1 wei of lp tokens
- Bob delegates all his 1023 tokens to Alice
- Alice tries to create another lock with her remaining 5e18 lp tokens but the function reverts

**SCENARIO 2**

- Alice creates lock in the `ve` with 10e18 lp token with intention of delegating to Max
- Bob creates 1024 locks with 1 wei of lp tokens
- Bob delegates all his 1024 tokens to Max
- Alice calls `delegate(max)`  but her call reverts because max has exceeded his maximum number of delegates
- the attack is cheap and it cost bob only 1024 wie of lptokens and gas


On the other hand, bob can continue to do this with as many users considering gas is cheap on IOTA network

        vm.startPrank(address(bob));
        for(uint i = 0; i < escrow.MAX_DELEGATES() - 1; i++) {
            flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), 1 wei);
            escrow.create_lock(1 wei, lockDuration);
        }
        escrow.delegate(alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Alice attempts to creates another lock but reverts
        vm.startPrank(address(alice));
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), 5e18);
        vm.expectRevert("dstRep would have too many tokenIds");
        escrow.create_lock(5e18, lockDuration);

        }
        escrow.delegate(max);

        escrow.create_lock(10e18, lockDuration);

        escrow.delegate(max);
        vm.stopPrank();

    }
```

Also note that this can also prevent alice from splittng her token

## Impact
A malicious actor can 
- block other users delegation
- prevent users from creating locks for themselves

## Tool used
Foundry Test

## Recommendation
A trivial solution is not recommended at the moment, however considering there is no block gs limit on the IOTA network, consider removing the 1024 max delegates restriction because IOTA uses a Tangle consensus mechanism which eliminates the concept of blocks with fixed sizes
