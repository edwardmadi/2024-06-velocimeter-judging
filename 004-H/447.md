# DOS for removal of delegates

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The delegation system on `VotingEscrow.sol` has the feature of `MAX_DELEGATES` check it [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1469) and it is a hardcoded value

On the other hand, users can  create locks with only 1 wei LP because `_create_lock()` only has this check 
```solidity
File: VotingEscrow.sol

         require(_value > 0); // dev: need non-zero value

```
Now, Take this scenario:
Alice owns veNFT_01 (with big weight) and she decides to delegate it to Bob
Malicious user back-run Alice tx and delegated to Alice a MAX_DELEGATES veNFT (only 1 wei LP)
After a period Alice will try to dis-delegate her veNFT_01 from Bob [This line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1469) will revert
```solidity
File: VotingEscrow.sol

1468:                 require(
1469:                     dstRepOld.length + ownerTokenCount <= MAX_DELEGATES,
1470:                     "dstRep would have too many tokenIds"
1471:                 );

```
The user is now forced to wait at least 52 weeks. however, they could repeat this attack.
  
## Impact
- The user is not able to remove his veNFT from the delegate for 52 Epoch.
- Anyone can deprivation users from receiving any delegations with this attack.  

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
omit `ownerTokenCount` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1469)
```diff
File: VotingEscrow.sol

1468:                 require(
- 1469:                     dstRepOld.length + ownerTokenCount <= MAX_DELEGATES,
+ 1469:                     dstRepOld.length <= MAX_DELEGATES,
1470:                     "dstRep would have too many tokenIds"
1471:                 );

```
Also, users can create any number of veNFT 
so, the user can own more than `MAX_DELEGATES` just by creating multiple veNFT 
This reinforces the Fix above
