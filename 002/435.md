# DOS attack by delegating tokens at `MAX_DELEGATES = 1024` in Voting escrow

## Target
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1266 

## Vulnerability Detail
In velocimeter v4contracts/ `VotingEscrow` contract,  the `MAX_DELEGATES` limit is set to `1024`.
This amount of delegates takes 25M gas to be processed. However if the contracts are deployed on EVM chains
having less than 25M gas block limit, example Optimism which has only 15M gas limit.There will be denial of service in system's core opeations especially during token transfer/withdrawal when there are 1024 delegated votes on a token. 

As the delegated tokens are maintained in an array that's vulnerable to DOS attack, the VotingEscrowhas a safety check
of MAX_DELEGATES = 1024 preventing an address from having a huge array. Given the current implementation,
any user with 1024 delegated tokens takes approximately 23M gas to transfer/burn/mint a token. However, the
current gas limit of the op chain is 15M. (ref: [Op-scan](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/block/78264200))

## Impact
- Permanent freezing of NFTs
- Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)
- Potential denial of service (DoS) attack on victims, preventing them from withdrawing/transferring/delegating.

## Code Snippet
VotingEscrow.sol

```solidity

// state variable
 Line 1266   uint256 public constant MAX_DELEGATES = 1024; // avoid too much gas
...
_moveTokenDelegates() method
L1398 :                require(dstTokensOld.length + 1 <= MAX_DELEGATES, "dst would have too many tokenIds");

...
_moveAllDelegates() method
//l1469:
 require(dstTokensOld.length + ownerTokenCount <= MAX_DELEGATES, "dst would have too many tokenIds");

```

The `_moveTokenDelegates` is invoked inside mint , burn & transferFrom

```solidity

  function _transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, address _sender) internal {
        //snip
        _moveTokenDelegates(delegates(_from), delegates(_to), _tokenId);
        //snip
    }
      function _mint(address _to, uint256 _tokenId) internal returns (bool) {
         //snip
        _moveTokenDelegates(address(0), delegates(_to), _tokenId);
        //snip
    }
    
      function _burn(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _value) internal {
         //snip
        _moveTokenDelegates(delegates(owner), address(0), _tokenId);
        //snip
        
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. **Adjust MAX_DELEGATES:** Reduce MAX_DELEGATES from 1024 to 128 to mitigate the risk of gas exhaustion during token transfer/withdrawal.
2. **Opt-out/Opt-in Mechanism:** Provide users with the option to opt-out/opt-in. Users should only accept delegated tokens if they opt-in. Alternatively, they can opt-out to refuse any uncommissioned delegated tokens.
