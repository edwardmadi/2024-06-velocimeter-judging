# `MAX_DELEGATES = 1024` could lead to DOS

## Summary
VotingEscrow contract, the MAX_DELEGATES limit is set to 1024. However, if the contracts are deployed on EVM chains with less than 25M gas block limit, especially Optimism which has only 15M gas limit, there will be denial of service in the system's core opeations especially during token transfer/withdrawal when there are 1024 delegated votes on a token.
## Vulnerability Detail
Any user can give their locked NFT balance to someone else using the `delegate` function. But in the `VotingEscrow` contract, there's a rule called `MAX_DELEGATES`. It stops any address from having too many tokens.

This rule helps to prevent attacks that could slow down or stop the contract.

Currently, if a user has 1024 delegated tokens, it takes about 25 million gas to move, burn or create new tokens.
But the gas limit on some target chains might be less than 25M gas, most importantly one of the optimism chain which is only 15M.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Set MAX_DELEGATES=1024 to 128;
2. Give users the option to opt-out/opt-in. Users will only accept the delegated tokens if they opt in; or users can opt out to reject all undelegated tokens.
can opt-out to refuse any unassigned delegated tokens.
