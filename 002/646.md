# timestamp of a checkpoint is never initialized

## Summary
timestamp of a checkpoint is never initialized nowhere in the codebase. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Timestamp of a checkpoint is used by various functions like  _findWhatCheckpointToWrite , getpastVotesIndex as can be seen below
```solidity
function _findWhatCheckpointToWrite(address account)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint32)
    {
        uint _timestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint32 _nCheckPoints = numCheckpoints[account];

        if (
            _nCheckPoints > 0 &&
            checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].timestamp == _timestamp
        ) {
            return _nCheckPoints - 1;
        } else {
            return _nCheckPoints;
        }
    }
```
```solidity
function getPastVotesIndex(address account, uint timestamp) public view returns (uint32) {
        uint32 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[account];
        if (nCheckpoints == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        // First check most recent balance
        if (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints - 1].timestamp <= timestamp) {
            return (nCheckpoints - 1);
        }

        // Next check implicit zero balance
        if (checkpoints[account][0].timestamp > timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint32 lower = 0;
        uint32 upper = nCheckpoints - 1;
        while (upper > lower) {
            uint32 center = upper - (upper - lower) / 2; // ceil, avoiding overflow
            Checkpoint storage cp = checkpoints[account][center];
            if (cp.timestamp == timestamp) {
                return center;
            } else if (cp.timestamp < timestamp) {
                lower = center;
            } else {
                upper = center - 1;
            }
        }
        return lower;
    }
```
As timestamp is not initialized anywhere which can lead wrong values returned by the above mentioned functions.
## Impact
MovetokenDelegates as well as getting past votes functionality gets broken.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialize the timestamp variable in the codebase.
