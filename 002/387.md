## Summary
The timestamp variable in the Checkpoint struct is not initialized, causing functions that rely on it, such as `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` and `getPastVotesIndex`, to malfunction. This results in incorrect checkpoint indexing and failed optimizations due to uninitialized timestamps.

## Vulnerability Detail
A checkpoint contains a timestamp variable which stores the block number the checkpoint is created.

lets focus on the function `getPastVotesIndex` and `findWhatCheckpointToWrite`

```javascript
/// @notice A checkpoint for marking delegated tokenIds from a given timestamp
    struct Checkpoint {
        uint timestamp;
        uint[] tokenIds;
    }
```
it is found that the timestamp variable of the checkpoint was not initialized anywhere in the codebase.
the `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` function verifies that the timestamp of the latest checkpoint  of an account is equal to the current block.timestamp. If true the  function will return the index number of the last checkpoint

```javascript
function _findWhatCheckpointToWrite(
        address account
    ) internal view returns (uint32) {
        uint _timestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint32 _nCheckPoints = numCheckpoints[account];

        if (
            _nCheckPoints > 0 &&
            checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].timestamp == _timestamp
        ) {
            return _nCheckPoints - 1;
        } else {
            return _nCheckPoints;
        }
    }
```
This function does not work as intended and will always return the index of the new checkpoint. The `getPastVotesIndex` function relies on the timestamp for the last checkpoint for optimization purposes. If the request timestamp is the most recently updated checkpoint it will return the  last index immediately and skip the binary search. Since the timestamp variable is not populated the optimization will not work

```javascript
 function getPastVotesIndex(
        address account,
        uint timestamp
    ) public view returns (uint32) {
        uint32 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[account];
        if (nCheckpoints == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        // First check most recent balance
        if (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints - 1].timestamp <= timestamp) {
            return (nCheckpoints - 1);
        }

        // Next check implicit zero balance
        if (checkpoints[account][0].timestamp > timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint32 lower = 0;
        uint32 upper = nCheckpoints - 1;
        while (upper > lower) {
            uint32 center = upper - (upper - lower) / 2; // ceil, avoiding overflow
            Checkpoint storage cp = checkpoints[account][center];
            if (cp.timestamp == timestamp) {
                return center;
            } else if (cp.timestamp < timestamp) {
                lower = center;
            } else {
                upper = center - 1;
            }
        }
        return lower;
    }
```
A checkpoint contains a timestamp variable which stores the block timestamp which the checkpoint is created.

However, it was found that the timestamp variable of a checkpoint was not initialized anywhere in the codebase. therefore, any function that relies on the timestamp of a chackpoint will break given that the `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` and `getPastVotesIndex` rely on the timestamp. 

* Instance 1 
The `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` function verifies if the timestamp of the latest checkpoint of an
account is equal to the current block timestamp. If true, the function will return the index number of the last checkpoint.

```javascript
function _findWhatCheckpointToWrite(
        address account
    ) internal view returns (uint32) {
        uint _timestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint32 _nCheckPoints = numCheckpoints[account];

        if (
            _nCheckPoints > 0 &&
            checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].timestamp == _timestamp
        ) {
            return _nCheckPoints - 1;
        } else {
            return _nCheckPoints;
        }
    }

```
As such, this function does not work as intended and will always return the index of a new checkpoint.

* Instance 2
The `getPastVotesIndex` function relies on the timestamp of the latest checkpoint for optimization
purposes. If the request block timestamp is the most recently updated checkpoint, it will return the latest index
immediately and skip the binary search. Since the timestamp variable is not populated, the optimization will not
work.

```javascript
function getPastVotesIndex(
        address account,
        uint timestamp
    ) public view returns (uint32) {
        uint32 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[account];
        if (nCheckpoints == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        // First check most recent balance
        if (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints - 1].timestamp <= timestamp) {
            return (nCheckpoints - 1);
        }

        // Next check implicit zero balance
        if (checkpoints[account][0].timestamp > timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint32 lower = 0;
        uint32 upper = nCheckpoints - 1;
        while (upper > lower) {
            uint32 center = upper - (upper - lower) / 2; // ceil, avoiding overflow
            Checkpoint storage cp = checkpoints[account][center];
            if (cp.timestamp == timestamp) {
                return center;
            } else if (cp.timestamp < timestamp) {
                lower = center;
            } else {
                upper = center - 1;
            }
        }
        return lower;
    }
```


## Impact
The `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` function always returns the index for a new checkpoint, leading to redundant entries.
The `getPastVotesIndex` function cannot optimize by returning the latest index, causing inefficiencies in vote retrieval and potentially incorrect vote calculations.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
 function _findWhatCheckpointToWrite(
        address account
    ) internal view returns (uint32) {
        uint _timestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint32 _nCheckPoints = numCheckpoints[account];

        if (
            _nCheckPoints > 0 &&
            checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].timestamp == _timestamp
        ) {
            return _nCheckPoints - 1;
        } else {
            return _nCheckPoints;
        }
    }
```
Then

```javascript
 function getPastVotesIndex(
        address account,
        uint timestamp
    ) public view returns (uint32) {
        uint32 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[account];
        if (nCheckpoints == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        // First check most recent balance
        if (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints - 1].timestamp <= timestamp) {
            return (nCheckpoints - 1);
        }

        // Next check implicit zero balance
        if (checkpoints[account][0].timestamp > timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint32 lower = 0;
        uint32 upper = nCheckpoints - 1;
        while (upper > lower) {
            uint32 center = upper - (upper - lower) / 2; // ceil, avoiding overflow
            Checkpoint storage cp = checkpoints[account][center];
            if (cp.timestamp == timestamp) {
                return center;
            } else if (cp.timestamp < timestamp) {
                lower = center;
            } else {
                upper = center - 1;
            }
        }
        return lower;
    }

```

## Recommendation
Initialize the timestamp variable of the checkpoint in the codebase. see similar fix [here](https://github.com/velodrome-finance/contracts/commit/a670bfb62c69fe38ac918b734a03b68a5505f8a2)
