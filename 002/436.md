# timestamp in checkpoint mapping is never initialized in VotingEscrow.sol

## Summary
uninitialized/unassigned variable.

## Vulnerability Detail
The timestamp here in checkpoint is never initialized in votingEscrow.sol
```solidity
struct Checkpoint {
        uint timestamp;
        uint[] tokenIds;
    }
```

```solidity
    /// @notice A record of delegated token checkpoints for each account, by index
    mapping(address => mapping(uint32 => Checkpoint)) public checkpoints;
```

The issue with this is that the timestamp that was never initialized is used to write conditions within the codebase like in `getPastVotesIndex()` & `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite()`

`getPastVotesIndex()`:

there are several instances like here -
```solidity
         // First check most recent balance
        if (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints - 1].timestamp <= timestamp) {//@audit it is used here 
            return (nCheckpoints - 1);
        }

        // Next check implicit zero balance
        if (checkpoints[account][0].timestamp > timestamp) {//@audit it is used here
            return 0;
        }
```

and here - 
```solidity
        while (upper > lower) {
            uint32 center = upper - (upper - lower) / 2; // ceil, avoiding overflow
            Checkpoint storage cp = checkpoints[account][center];
            if (cp.timestamp == timestamp) { // @audit it is used here 
                return center;
```


`_findWhatCheckpointToWrite()`:

```solidity
        if (
            _nCheckPoints > 0 &&
            checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].timestamp == _timestamp // @audit here it is used to compare
        ) {
            return _nCheckPoints - 1;
        } else {
            return _nCheckPoints;
        }
```


## Impact
VotingEscrow.sol's `getPastVotesIndex()` & `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite()` functions won't work as intended since checkpoints.timestamp is never set anywhere in VotingEscrow.sol
