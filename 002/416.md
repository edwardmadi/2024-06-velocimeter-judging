# The owner of `veNFT` could suffer a DOS attack when transferring, withdrawing or minting their `veNFT` tokens

## Summary
The gas consumed could reach the block gas limit when a veNFT token is minted, withdrawn or transferred.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a veNFT token is minted/withdrawn/transferred, its delegation could be moved by calling [`_moveTokenDelegates()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1362-L1411). A delegatee can be delegated up to 1024 tokens:
```solidity
1398:                require(
1399:                    dstRepOld.length + 1 <= MAX_DELEGATES,
1400:                    "dstRep would have too many tokenIds"
1401:                );
```
It could take approximately 25M gas to read and write up to 1024 tokenIds in `_moveTokenDelegates()`. However, the current gas limit in Avalanche and Scroll is far less than this:
- [Avalanche: 15M](https://subnets.avax.network/en/c-chain/block/48341970)
- [Scroll: 10M](https://scrollscan.com/block/7710144)

An attacker might mint as many veNFTs as possible and delegate them to the victims' delegatee until the gas limit is reached, resulting the victim being unable to delegate, transfer or withdraw their veNFT token.

## Impact
The owner of veNFT could suffer a DOS attack when transferring, withdrawing or minting their veNFT tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the value of `MAX_DELEGATES` to `256` or less, The gas consumption of transferring, withdrawing or minting veNFT will be capped at no more than 7M.
