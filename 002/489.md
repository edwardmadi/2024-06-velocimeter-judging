# `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite()` and `getPastVotesIndex()` will not work because `Checkpoint.timestamp` is not initialized

## Summary

`_findWhatCheckpointToWrite()` and `getPastVotesIndex()` will not work because `Checkpoint.timestamp` is not initialized.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `VotingEscrow.sol`, we have `Checkpoint` struct:

```solidity
    struct Checkpoint {
        uint timestamp; 
        uint[] tokenIds;
    }
```

The `timestamp` variable is not initialized anywhere in the codebase. This means that the two functions (`_findWhatCheckpointToWrite()` and `getPastVotesIndex()`) that rely on it will not work.

The problem occurs in the following places:

In `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite()`:
```solidity
if (
            _nCheckPoints > 0 &&
            checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].timestamp == _timestamp 
        )
```

In `getPastVotesIndex()`:
```solidity
        if (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints - 1].timestamp <= timestamp) { 
            return (nCheckpoints - 1);
        }
```
## Impact

- Break two core contract functionality. 
- The optimization in `getPastVotesIndex()` will not work. 
- The `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite()` function will always return the index of a new checkpoint.

## Recommendation

Initialize the `timestamp` variable of the checkpoint in the codebase.
