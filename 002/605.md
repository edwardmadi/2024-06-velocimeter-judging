# Uninitialized checkpoint timestamp in VotingEscrow contract leads to incorrect distribution of delegated tokens


## Summary
A checkpoint in the VotingEscrow contract contains a timestamp variable, which is intended to store the block number when the checkpoint is created. However, this variable is not initialized anywhere in the codebase, causing functions that rely on it to break.

## Vulnerability Detail
The timestamp variable within the Checkpoint struct is not initialized in the codebase. This causes any function that relies on the timestamp of a checkpoint to fail.

The following functions depend on the timestamp of a checkpoint:
- VotingEscrow._findWhatCheckpointToWrite
- VotingEscrow.getPastVotesIndex

These functions are used in various other functions:
- _findWhatCheckpointToWrite -> _moveTokenDelegates -> _transferFrom
- _findWhatCheckpointToWrite -> _moveTokenDelegates -> _mint
- _findWhatCheckpointToWrite -> _moveTokenDelegates -> _burn
- _findWhatCheckpointToWrite -> _moveAllDelegates -> _delegate -> delegate/delegateBySig
- getPastVotesIndex -> getPastVotes

Due to the uninitialized timestamp variable, these functions will not work correctly, potentially causing disruptions in the functionality of the contract.

## Impact
- Failure of functions that rely on the timestamp variable in the Checkpoint struct.
- Disruption of voting and delegation processes in the VotingEscrow contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialize the timestamp variable of the checkpoint in the codebase. Ensure that every time a checkpoint is created, the timestamp variable is set to the current block number.
