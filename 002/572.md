# ````VotingEscrow._moveTokenDelegates()```` would work abnormally while called more than once for same ````Rep```` in one block

## Summary
The current implementation of  ````VotingEscrow._moveTokenDelegates()```` can not process the situation that a ````Rep````'s delegated NFT list is changed more than once in one block.

## Vulnerability Detail
Please pay attention on ````L1373```` and ````L1423````, the ````nextSrcRepNum```` would be ```` _nCheckPoints - 1```` if a second try in one block (````timestamp```` keeps same) to update ````checkpoints```` for same ````Rep````, which results in ````srcRepOld```` and ````srcRepNew```` points to the same ````storage````. Then, the ````for```` loop for coping token IDs (````L1378~1383````) becomes flawed. As ````srcRepOld.length```` (L1378) increases by ````1```` after each ````push()````, which incurs dead loop and burn all available gas.

## Impact
Transactions from users with same ````Reps```` would fail unexpectedly and all available gas is burned.
