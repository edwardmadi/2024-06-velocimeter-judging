# Duplicated tokenIDs within a checkpoint could result in inconsistent states and governance manipulation

## Summary
Duplicated tokenIDs within a checkpoint could result in inconsistent states and governance manipulation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` function within the `VotingEscrow._moveTokenDelegates` and `VotingEscrow._moveAllDelegates` functions does not always return the index of a new checkpoint. If the function is called more than once within the same block, it will return the index of the last checkpoint instead of creating a new one. This can lead to the following issues:

1. Duplicate Entries: If `_moveTokenDelegates` or `_moveAllDelegates` are called multiple times within the same block, the same checkpoint might be updated multiple times, resulting in duplicate token IDs.

2. Inconsistent State: This can cause an inconsistent state where the token delegation data does not accurately reflect the actual token ownership and delegation.

3. Inflated Voting Balance: Malicious users could exploit this by performing multiple delegations within the same block, inflating the voting balance of their accounts. This can allow them to participate in governance and gauge weight voting with an inflated balance, potentially causing loss of assets or rewards for other users.

## Impact
Governance Manipulation: By inflating their voting balance, malicious users can influence governance decisions and gauge weight voting to their advantage, redirecting rewards and causing potential loss of assets or rewards for other users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Ensure Correct Checkpoint Handling: Update the `_moveTokenDelegates` and `_moveAllDelegates` functions to ensure that a new checkpoint is created whenever the functions are called, even if it is within the same block.

2. Prevent Duplicate Entries: Implement logic to ensure that the token IDs in the checkpoints are unique and accurately reflect the state of token ownership and delegation.

3. Maintain Consistent State: Ensure that each token delegation operation accurately reflects the state of token ownership and delegation, even when multiple operations occur within the same block.
