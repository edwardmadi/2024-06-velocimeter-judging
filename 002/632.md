# No recording timestamp in `VotingEscrow._moveTokenDelegates` function

## Summary

In the `VotingEscrow._moveTokenDelegates` function, it doesn't record the timestamp in checkpoints variables.
As a result, `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` and `getPastVotesIndex` which use the `timestamp` return incorrect value.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `VotingEscrow._moveTokenDelegates` function, it doesn't record the timestamp in checkpoints variables.

The `getPastVotesIndex` function search the checkpoint corresponding to the specified timestamp.
Because all checkpoints variables don't record timestamp, the `getPastVotesIndex` function returns incorrect value.
As a result, the `getPastVotes` function returns incorrect value and this makes the governance be unfair.
Also, the `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` function returns incorrect value.

## Impact

The governance is performed unfairly.
the `_findWhatCheckpointToWrite` function does not work as intended and will always return the index of a new checkpoint.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add the code that record the timestamp into checkpoints variables in the `VotingEscrow._moveTokenDelegates` and `VotingEscrow._moveAllDelegates` functions
