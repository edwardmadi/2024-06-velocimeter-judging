# The `timestamp`  variable of a checkpoint is not initialized

## Summary
A checkpoint contains a `timestamp` variable which stores the `block.timestamp` the checkpoint is created :

```solidity
 /// @notice A checkpoint for marking delegated tokenIds from a given timestamp
    struct Checkpoint {
        uint256 timestamp;
        uint256[] tokenIds;
    }
```

However, it was found that the `timestamp` variable of a checkpoint was not initialized anywhere in the codebase.
Therefore, any function that relies on the `timestamp` of a checkpoint will break.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `VotingEscrow._findWhatCheckpointToWrite` and `VotingEscrow.getPastVotesIndex` functions were found
to rely on the fromBlock variable of a checkpoint for computation. The following is a list of functions that calls
these two affected functions.

```solidity
_findWhatCheckpointToWrite -> _moveTokenDelegates -> _transferFrom
_findWhatCheckpointToWrite -> _moveTokenDelegates -> _mint
_findWhatCheckpointToWrite -> _moveTokenDelegates -> _burn
_findWhatCheckpointToWrite -> _moveAllDelegates -> _delegate -> delegate/delegateBySig

getPastVotesIndex -> getPastVotes 

```

## Instance 1 - `VotingEscrow._findWhatCheckpointToWrite` function :

The `VotingEscrow._findWhatCheckpointToWrite` function verifies if the `timestamp` of the latest checkpoint of an
account is equal to the current block.timestamp . If true, the function will return the index number of the last checkpoint.

```solidity
  function _findWhatCheckpointToWrite(address account) internal view returns (uint32) {
        uint256 _timestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint32 _nCheckPoints = numCheckpoints[account];

        if (_nCheckPoints > 0 && checkpoints[account][_nCheckPoints - 1].timestamp == _timestamp) {
            return _nCheckPoints - 1;
        } else {
            return _nCheckPoints;
        }
    }
```

As such, this function does not work as intended and will always return the index of a new checkpoint.

## Instance 2 - `VotingEscrow.getPastVotesIndex` function :

```solidity
 function getPastVotesIndex(address account, uint256 timestamp) public view returns (uint32) {
        uint32 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[account];
        if (nCheckpoints == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        // First check most recent balance
        if (checkpoints[account][nCheckpoints - 1].timestamp <= timestamp) {
            return (nCheckpoints - 1);
        }

        // Next check implicit zero balance
        if (checkpoints[account][0].timestamp > timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint32 lower = 0;
        uint32 upper = nCheckpoints - 1;
        while (upper > lower) {
            uint32 center = upper - (upper - lower) / 2; // ceil, avoiding overflow
            Checkpoint storage cp = checkpoints[account][center];
            if (cp.timestamp == timestamp) {
                return center;
            } else if (cp.timestamp < timestamp) {
                lower = center;
            } else {
                upper = center - 1;
            }
        }
        return lower;
    }
```

The `VotingEscrow.getPastVotesIndex` function relies on the `timestamp` of the latest checkpoint for optimization
purposes. If the request `block.timestamp`  is the most recently updated checkpoint, it will return the latest index
immediately and skip the binary search. Since the `timestamp` variable is not populated, the optimization will not
work.

## Impact
Functions that relies on the `timestamp` of a checkpoint will break.
