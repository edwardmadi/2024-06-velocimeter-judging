# Wrong percentage for team emission

## Summary
The `MAX_TEAM_RATE` is not respected [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Minter.sol#L119-L120) comment said  5% max, but the calculation doesn't respect the cap.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Minter.sol` will mint weekly emissions for gauges and the team will mint a percentage from the weekly emissions.
the `teamRate` is the responsible value for identifying how much the team Emissions this week by performing a simple calculation

```solidity
File: Minter.sol

119:                         uint _teamEmissions = (teamRate * weekly) /
120:                 (PRECISION - teamRate);
```
However, Thereâ€™s no reason why it subtracts `teamRate` from Precision. Precision should be standard. 
example if `teamRate == 50` which is 5%
`(50 * 100e18) / (1000 - 50) =  5.2e18`
but in case of 5% it should return 5e18

## Impact
`update_period()` calculation/transfer of the wrong percentage as a team Emissions

+ 120:                 (PRECISION );
