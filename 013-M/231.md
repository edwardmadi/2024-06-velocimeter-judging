# Miscalculation of team emissions in Minter contract

## Summary
When a period is updated in the minter and FLOW tokens are emitted for distribution to the Voter contract, the team emissions are supposed to be 5% at most from the weekly emissions, however they are calculated to 5.26% because of incorrect division.
## Vulnerability Detail
The team emissions are calculated in the Minter's `update_period()` function which sends FLOW rewards to the Voter contract every week and it also sends a chunk of that to the Velocimeter team address.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Minter.sol#L112-L137
```solidity
    function update_period() external returns (uint) {
        uint _period = active_period;
        if (block.timestamp >= _period + WEEK && initializer == address(0)) { // only trigger if new week
            _period = (block.timestamp / WEEK) * WEEK;
            active_period = _period;
            uint256 weekly = weekly_emission();

â†’           uint _teamEmissions = (teamRate * weekly) /
                (PRECISION - teamRate);
            uint _required =  weekly + _teamEmissions;
            uint _balanceOf = _flow.balanceOf(address(this));
            if (_balanceOf < _required) {
                _flow.mint(address(this), _required - _balanceOf);
            }

            require(_flow.transfer(teamEmissions, _teamEmissions));

            _checkpointRewardsDistributors();

            _flow.approve(address(_voter), weekly);
            _voter.notifyRewardAmount(weekly);

            emit Mint(msg.sender, weekly, circulating_supply());
        }
        return _period;
    }
```

The problem with the `_teamEmissions` calculation is that it divides by less than 100%, so effectively the team emissions will be more than expected.
Let's say the `teamRate` is the `MAX_TEAM_RATE` of 50. `PRECISION` is equal to 1000, so the equation comes out as: $(50 * weekly) / (1000 - 50) = weekly * 50 / 950 = weekly * 0,0526315789$

And instead of taking the maximum of 5% as the code clearly indicates, it'll take 5.26% instead.

```solidity
    uint public constant MAX_TEAM_RATE = 50; // 5% max
```
## Impact
Team emissions will be more than the maximum which will affect directly the issuance of FLOW tokens and thus its inflation rate.

## Recommendation
Change the `_teamEmissions` calculation to `(teamRate * weekly) / PRECISION` instead of `(teamRate * weekly) / (PRECISION - teamRate)`.
