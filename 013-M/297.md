# Incorrect calculation of team emissions in the `Minter` contract.

## Summary

The team emissions exceed the expected amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract states that team emissions should not exceed 5%:
`uint public constant MAX_TEAM_RATE = 50; // 5% max`

However, in the `update_period()` function, team emissions are miscalculated:

```solidity
            uint _teamEmissions = (teamRate * weekly) /
                (PRECISION - teamRate);
```

## Impact

This results in overinflation of team emissions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use only `PRECISION` as the denominator:

```solidity
uint _teamEmissions = (teamRate * weekly) / PRECISION;
```
