# Incorrect `_teamEmissions` calculation in Minter

## Summary
In the Minter contract, when calculating `_teamEmissions` amount, `teamRate` is subtracted from the denominator causing the calculation to be incorrect.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `teamRate` specifies the percent of the `weekly` distribution that is minted on top of the `weekly` value. Currently it's set to 50 bps in the constructor indicating 5% ( 3 decimal basis points, as the `PRECISION` constant is equal to 1000 ). However, the actual `_teamEmissions` is `50 / 995`, which is 5.3%:
```solidity
           uint _teamEmissions = (teamRate * weekly) / (PRECISION - teamRate);
```
Considering that the weekly emission is 2000 tokens per gauge, it assigns at least 6 more tokens than intended for the team emissions. 
## Impact
The impact is of low severity- the Minter contract simply mints more tokens than specified. However, the likelihood is high as it happens always during reward claiming.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
```diff
-          uint _teamEmissions = (teamRate * weekly) / (PRECISION - teamRate);
+          uint _teamEmissions = (teamRate * weekly) / PRECISION;
```
