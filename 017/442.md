# Swap will revert if `fee0` or `fee1` is zero


## Summary

Revert on line 280 is not avoided on line 140 on right below. Previously on v3 pair, `notifyRewardAmount` is called only if amount > 0 on line 142 on left below. Now `_sendTokenFees` doesn't care if amount > or == 0, and this is an issue becasue `swap` will revert on cases listed in vulnerability section.

```solidity

ExternalBribe.sol

279:     function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
280:  >>>    require(amount > 0);
281:         if (!isReward[token]) {
282:           require(IVoter(voter).isWhitelisted(token), "bribe tokens must be whitelisted");
283:           require(rewards.length < MAX_REWARD_TOKENS, "too many rewards tokens");
284:         }
... SNP ...

## Vulnerability Detail

Pair v4 and v3 has fee calculation similar, but the validation and placement of code is different in this flow.

1. The check if `amount0In > 0` and `hasGauge` is same as v3. But if `fee0` is > 0 check is done in v3 so that it wont revert on line 280 shown above in `ExternalBribe.notifyRewardAmount`.
2. Becasue there is a check if `amount > 0` on `_sendTokenFees` in v3 pair, but on v4 pair, it calls notify reward without validation. And this causes swap to revert on certain like,
    - Gauge creation allows to create gauge if one of the tokens in pair is whitelisted ([check here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/GaugePlugin.sol#L61-L62)). So in these pairs, if the swap is called in a way fee0 or fee1 become 0, then thats wap will revert. Maybe some flashloan users get affected, low decimal tokens get affected.

## Impact
Swap will revert if fee0 or fee1 is zero due tio missing check on `_sendTokenFees`. Since its a important function of system, its high impact if reverts but with low likelihood, So giving medium severity
