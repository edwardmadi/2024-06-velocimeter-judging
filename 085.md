# Use of Strict Equality on Tokens/Ether

## Summary
Using strict equality (==) under certain conditions can cause unexpected behavior, either intentionally or unintentionally.

## Vulnerability Detail
This vulnerability is located on line 507, within the _'withdraw(uint amount)'_ function. This function checks whether the withdrawn _'amount'_ amount is equal to the _'balanceOf[msg.sender]'_ balance. If this condition is met, _'tokenId'_ is set to _'tokenIds[msg.sender]'_. The problem arises due to the use of the strict equality (==) operator which checks for strict equality between two values. This can cause problems if there is a small change to _'balanceOf[msg.sender]'_ that means this condition is no longer met.

## Impact
The use of strict equality can lead to scenarios where withdrawals that should be valid are not processed correctly. In the context of smart contracts, this can be exploited to cause service failure or to manipulate contract logic.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To avoid this problem, it is recommended to use more flexible operators such as >= or <=. In this context, if your goal is to ensure that the withdrawn _'amount'_ does not exceed the user's balance, use >=. Here are the recommended modifications for the _'withdraw'_ function:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint amount) public {
    uint tokenId = 0;
    if (amount >= balanceOf[msg.sender]) {
        tokenId = tokenIds[msg.sender];
    }
    withdrawToken(amount, tokenId);
}
```
