# Lack of expiration and slippage protection

## Summary
User receives oTokens for locking their FLOW/WETH tokens. These oTokens can be exercised the following way:
> 1) Exercise() - This option allows users to convert oTOKEN to TOKEN. Usually this option is the most expensive.

> 2) ExerciseLP() - This option allows users to convert their oTOKEN to an LP token, which are automatically deposited into reward gauges on Velocimeter with a scaling lock time. This lock time Min and Max are determined by the project before the oTOKEN is deployed. The cost of this option scales with the selected lock time by the users. However, a project that wants, can elect to simplify this and have a constant lock time. Furthermore, users will need to bring enough of the other token in the LP to produce the LP, but these tokens are in still theirs.

> 3) ExerciseVE() - This options is only used for project that utilize the veNFT model. However, it allows users to convert their oTOKENs into a veNFT. This is usually the cheapest option.

The problem lies in `addLiquidity` logic input parameter.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model, proposers have advanced knowledge of whether they will propose a single block or a series of consecutive blocks. In this context, a malevolent validator can delay a transaction and choose to execute it at a more opportune block number.

When exercising options of either `ExerciseLP()` and `ExerciseVE()`, the user can input the expiration deadline, this however wasn't passed into the router of `addLiquidity` but instead block.timestamp was used. 

Furthermore, the minAmount used is 1, which allows high slippage of tokens hence receiving lesser tokens.

            address(this),
            block.timestamp //@audit-issue _deadline is not included here
        );
    -- SNIP --

```

## Impact
1) This provides no safeguard since `block.timestamp` will reflect the timestamp of the block in which the transaction is included. Consequently, malicious validators can indefinitely withhold the transaction.
2) Vulnerable to sandwich attack
