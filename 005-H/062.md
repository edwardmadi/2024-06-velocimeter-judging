# Lack of slippage control for exerciseVe()/exerciseLp()

## Summary
When we calculate `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity` in exerciseVe()/exerciseLp(), we use the current pool's reserve token amount. This can be manipulated easily and we don't have one input parameter to do the slippage control.

## Vulnerability Detail
In exerciseVe()/exerciseLp(), we will transfer some payment tokens to convert oFLOW to FLOW with one discount, and at the meantime, we need to transfer some other payment tokens to add liquidity. 
The input parameter `_maxPaymentAmount` is one slippage control for the first part payment tokens. It means if users have to pay too much payment tokens to convert oFLOW to liquid FLOW tokens, the transaction will be reverted. 
The vulnerability is that there is no slippage control for the second part of payment tokens, which will be added into the pair. Malicious use can manipulate the pool token's price before the user exerciseLP(). The normal user may have to add liquidity with one very unfair price.
```javascript
    function _exerciseLp(
        uint256 _amount,   // the oTOKEN amount the user wants to redeem with
        uint256 _maxPaymentAmount,
        address _recipient,
        uint256 _discount
    ) internal returns (uint256 paymentAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
        ...
        // burn callers tokens
        _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
        (uint256 paymentAmount,uint256 paymentAmountToAddLiquidity) =  getPaymentTokenAmountForExerciseLp(_amount,_discount);
        if (paymentAmount > _maxPaymentAmount)
            revert OptionToken_SlippageTooHigh();
        ...
}
    function getPaymentTokenAmountForExerciseLp(uint256 _amount,uint256 _discount) public view returns (uint256 paymentAmount, uint256 paymentAmountToAddLiquidity)
    {
        paymentAmount = _discount == 0 ? 0 : getLpDiscountedPrice(_amount, _discount);
        (uint256 underlyingReserve, uint256 paymentReserve) = IRouter(router).getReserves(underlyingToken, paymentToken, false);
        paymentAmountToAddLiquidity = (_amount * paymentReserve) / underlyingReserve;
    }
```

## Impact
Lack of slippage control for exerciseVe()/exerciseLp(), users may add liquidity with one very unfair price.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add another slippage control parameter for payment tokens which will be added into the liquidity.
