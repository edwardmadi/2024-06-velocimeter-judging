# Exercising to LP can be manipulated

## Summary
in Function `exerciseVe` and `exerciseLP`  `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity` that is used to exercise for LP tokens ,can be easily manipulated

## Vulnerability Detail
 `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity` is used by users for exercising their option tokens to receive LP tokens , the problem lies in how 
 `paymentAmountToAddliquidty` is calculated .
  `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity = (_amount * paymentReserve) / underlyingReserve; ` as we can see ,
 `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity` is calculated based of the current reserves in the pool of the pair ,
 essentially calculating the amount paid for corresponding LP tokens received depends on the current pool reserves , which is easily 
 manipulatable via flashloans .
 Attacker trading large amounts in the pool can increase or decrease the value of an LP token .
 lets say  GAS/FLOW  is the underlying pool , an attacker can flashloan and enter the pool with one of the assets and greatly influence 
 the currently fetched Reserves to make the exercising of `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity` calculation to be done with skewed assets 
 reserves , resulting in less or more LP tokens received by users , that attack becomes especially profitable when the pool has low 
 liqudity giving the attacker the opportunity to dramatically influence the assets in the pool .
## Impact
 `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity` being easily manipulated could result in fewer or more LP being received when adding liquidity 
  which will result in an attacker receiving more LP tokens than he should or attacker can hurt users by making them receive less LP 
  tokens when adding liquidity.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 incorporating a Twap system for fetching the `paymentAmountToAddliquidty` similar to how `paymentamount` is fetched with `getTimeWeightedAveragePrice` should fix the problem .
