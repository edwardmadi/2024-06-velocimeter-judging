# `addLiquidity()` function is called with lack of working deadline and slippage protection

## Summary
`addLiquidity()` function is called with lack of effective deadline and slippage protection  

## Vulnerability Detail
the contract `OptionTokenV4.sol` : `_exerciseLp()` and `_exerciseLp` function uses uniswap `addLiquidity()` function with the set values of 1 for both slippage protection ` uint amountAMin,uint amountBMin,` so there is no slippage protection at all in this part and the `deadline` parameter set to `block.timestamps` which means there is no deadline check at all and is not effective. 

## Impact
The transaction can be pending in mempool for a long and the trading activity is very time senstive. Without deadline check, the trade transaction can be executed in a long time after the user submit the transaction, at that time, the trade can be done in a sub-optimal price, which harms user's position.

The deadline check ensure that the transaction can be executed on time and the expired transaction revert.
## Code Snippet

```solidity
    (, , lpAmount) = IRouter(router).addLiquidity(
            underlyingToken,
            paymentToken,
            false,
            _amount,
            paymentAmountToAddLiquidity,
            1,
            1,
            address(this),
            block.timestamp
        );

```

## Recommendation

- consider using real and effective deadline and slippage values ( slippage values should not be calculated onchain can be from user side or using uniswap sdk...)
