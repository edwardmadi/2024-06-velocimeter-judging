# There is no slippage protection properly in function exerciseVe/exerciseLp.

## Summary
In function IRouter(router).addLiquidity, by default  amountAMin is 1 and amountBMin is 1.users can’t put their expected  amountAMin and amountBMin.

function exerciseVe/exerciseLp transaction can be front run by the attacker so that amountA and amountB become much less.

## Vulnerability Detail
When function exerciseVe/exerciseLp is called, this function calls router’s addLiquidity function where bydefaults amountAMin is 1,amountBMin is 1. Attackers can frontrun and make the price unstable as a result amountA and amountB will be less than expected.

## Impact

function exerciseVe/exerciseLp transaction can be front run by the attacker so that amountA and amountB become much less.
