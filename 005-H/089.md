# `OptionTokenV4#_exerciseVe()`& `OptionTokenV4#_exerciseLp()` both lack any slipage protection


## Summary

When exercising VE, liquidity us being added without slippage/deadline protection

## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L626-L637

```solidity
    function exerciseVe(
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _maxPaymentAmount,
        address _recipient,
        uint256 _discount,
        uint256 _deadline
    ) external returns (uint256, uint256,uint256) {
        if (block.timestamp > _deadline) revert OptionToken_PastDeadline();
        return _exerciseVe(_amount, _maxPaymentAmount,_discount, _recipient);
    }

//which calls
    function _exerciseVe {
        <!-- ...snip -->
        (, , lpAmount) = IRouter(router).addLiquidity(
            underlyingToken,
            paymentToken,
            false,
            _amount,
            paymentAmountToAddLiquidity,
            //@audit 99.9% slippage hardcoded
            1,
            1,
            address(this),
            block.timestamp//@audit no deadline
        );

        <!-- ...snip -->
}

```

This is part of the function that exercises options tokens to purchase the underlying tokens.Evidently, no slippage is applied when excercising the ve, neither is a deadline applied, which could lead to receving unwanted amounts.

And then having to lock very minute values for exercisers [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L637-L645).

## Impact

As hinted under _Vulenrability Details_, this could lead to having users exercising options in an unfair rate, where the the liquidity that's received would be diluted to `0` since no slipage is applied [when creating the lps for the users](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L623).

Would be key to note that the same bug case is applicable here in `OptionTokenV4#_exerciseLp()` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L652-L716

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider attaching a real life slippage value.
