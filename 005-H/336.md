# Lack of adequate slippage protection in `OptionTokenV4.sol:_exerciseLp` can lead to loss of funds.

## Summary

The `OptionTokenV4.sol:_exerciseLp` function adds liquidity to an AMM pool, then deposits and locks the lp token into a Guage. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The problem is that the `IRouter(router).addLiquidity` that adds liquidity to the pool has an argument of `amountAMin = 1` and `amountBMin = 1`, which is too low, this small value means that you are willing to get very low liquidity token in case of a sharp price change or a sandwich attack that drastically change the price.

An attacker can sandwich the `OptionTokenV4.sol:exerciseLp` with a huge swap that drastically change the price, this will cause very few lp tokens to be minted by the `IRouter(router).addLiquidity` call due to lack of adequate slipage protection.

## Impact

Loss of Funds as less Lp tokens would be minted for large amout of funds

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L626

```sol
    function _exerciseLp(
        uint256 _amount,   // the oTOKEN amount the user wants to redeem with
        uint256 _maxPaymentAmount, // the 
        address _recipient,
        uint256 _discount
    ) internal returns (uint256 paymentAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
        ...
        (, , lpAmount) = IRouter(router).addLiquidity(
            underlyingToken,
            paymentToken,
            false,
            _amount,
            paymentAmountToAddLiquidity,
@->            1,
@->            1,
            address(this),
            block.timestamp
        );

        ...
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

# Recommendation

Allow the user to specify `amountAMin` and `amountBMin`, you can do this by adding them as parameters to the `_exerciseLp` function.

```diff
    function _exerciseLp(
        uint256 _amount,   // the oTOKEN amount the user wants to redeem with
        uint256 _maxPaymentAmount, // the 
        address _recipient,
        uint256 _discount
+       uint256 _amountAMin,
+       uint256 _amountBMin,
    ) internal returns (uint256 paymentAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
        ...
        (, , lpAmount) = IRouter(router).addLiquidity(
            underlyingToken,
            paymentToken,
            false,
            _amount,
            paymentAmountToAddLiquidity,
-           1,
-           1,
+           _amountAMin,
+           _amountBMin,
            address(this),
            block.timestamp
        );

        ...
    }
```
