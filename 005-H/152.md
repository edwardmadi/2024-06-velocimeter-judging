# Slippage protection is invalid

## Summary
In the `OptionTokenV4._exerciseVe()` function, the slippage protection set in `Router(router).addLiquidity()` is ineffective, making the protocol susceptible to sandwich attacks. 
## Vulnerability Detail

In the `OptionTokenV4.getPaymentTokenAmountForExerciseLp()` function, the protocol initially calculates `paymentAmount`, followed by the calculation of `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity` based on the most recent reserves. 
```solidity
    function getPaymentTokenAmountForExerciseLp(uint256 _amount,uint256 _discount) public view returns (uint256 paymentAmount, uint256 paymentAmountToAddLiquidity)
    {
       
        paymentAmount = _discount == 0 ? 0 : getLpDiscountedPrice(_amount, _discount);
        (uint256 underlyingReserve, uint256 paymentReserve) = IRouter(router).getReserves(underlyingToken, paymentToken, false);
        paymentAmountToAddLiquidity = (_amount * paymentReserve) / underlyingReserve;
    }

```
However, in the `_exerciseVe()` function, the protocol only validates that `paymentAmount` must be less than or equal to `_maxPaymentAmount`, and does not validate that `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity` aligns with the user's expected value. 
```solidity
    if (paymentAmount > _maxPaymentAmount)
            revert OptionToken_SlippageTooHigh();
          
        // Take team fee
        uint256 paymentGaugeRewardAmount = _discount == 0 ? 0 : _takeFees(
            paymentToken,
            paymentAmount
        );
        _safeTransferFrom(
            paymentToken,
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            paymentGaugeRewardAmount + paymentAmountToAddLiquidity
        );


```

This creates a vulnerability where a malicious user can front-run and manipulate the reserves, potentially causing the user to incur a higher `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity`.
Later on, the protocol calls `IRouter(router).addLiquidity()` to add liquidity. 
```solidity
 (, , lpAmount) = IRouter(router).addLiquidity(
            underlyingToken,
            paymentToken,
            false,
            _amount,
            paymentAmountToAddLiquidity,
            1,
            1,
            address(this),
            block.timestamp
        );

```

The parameters `amountAMin` and `amountBMin` passed to addLiquidity() are 1 and 1. We know that `amountAMin` and `amountBMin` serve as slippage protection, but passing 1 and 1 does not provide this protection, making it susceptible to sandwich attacks.


## Impact
The protocol is susceptible to sandwich attacks.
