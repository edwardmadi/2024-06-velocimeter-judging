Melted Quartz Rattlesnake

High

# h-02 non-trusted procedure 0xaliyah

## Summary

1. missing correctness for the check, effect, and interaction, pattern

## Vulnerability Detail

1. L530 hands control to non-trusted token transfer procedure where the effect kind procedure on L532 should execute first
2. token burn state change on L532 should take priority to execute as an effect and prior to L530 token transfer was visited

## Impact

1. may be labeled for high vulnerability
2. might have to follow recommended pattern of check, effect, and interaction
