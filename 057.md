# Signature malleability in `Pair.sol::permit`

## Summary

The `ecrecover` built-in solidity function can return a valid address
from malformed signature. Subtly altered signature can still be valid
under secp256k1 curve on the EVM, and thus deceive the contract 
accepting a transaction signature that been tampered upon.

## Vulnerability Detail 

In the context of the Router.sol:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Router.sol#L320

the `Pair::permit` function is used to facilitate delegated token spending by leveraging the EIP-2612. 

```javascript
function permit(address owner, address spender, uint value, uint deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external {
 ...
    // Create digest for signature verification
    bytes32 digest = keccak256(
        abi.encodePacked(
            '\x19\x01',
            DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
            keccak256(abi.encode(PERMIT_TYPEHASH, owner, spender, value, nonces[owner]++, deadline)) // increment the nonce creating a different nonce
        )
    );

    // Recover signer address from signature
    address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);
    require(recoveredAddress != address(0) && recoveredAddress == owner, 'Pair: INVALID_SIGNATURE');

    // Update allowance and emit Approval event
    allowance[owner][spender] = value;
    emit Approval(owner, spender, value);
}
```

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the signature components (r, s, v) while still producing a valid signature under the secp256k1 curve. This allows the attacker to deceive the contract into accepting a modified signature as legitimate, thereby gaining unauthorized access to approve token transfers on behalf of the owner.

Although there is an nonce increment in the `digest` variable that 
stops instant replay attacks the s and v values can still be adjusted 
producing a valid signature.

## Impact

Loss of assets for the user that has staked in a LP, as an attacker can permit on behalf of the user stealing his funds by removing liquidity from the pair pool.

## Recommendation

Consider using `recover()` function from OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library.
