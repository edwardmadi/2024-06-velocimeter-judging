# `killGaugeTotally` will result in permanently locked `veNFTs`

## Summary
`killGaugeTotally` will result in permanently locked `veNFTs`

## Vulnerability Detail
When a gauge is totally killed, all of the following storage values are cleared.

```solidity
    function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugeKillAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Restart gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");

        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];

        delete isAlive[_gauge];
        delete external_bribes[_gauge];
        delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
        delete isGauge[_gauge];
        delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

        killedGauges.push(_gauge);

        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }
```

However, in case a user has voted towards the totally killed gauge, their `veNFT` will be stuck as when they try to withdraw it, it will attempt a call to `address(0)`. 

```solidity
            if (_votes != 0) {
                _updateFor(gauges[_pool]);
                weights[_pool] -= _votes;
                votes[_tokenId][_pool] -= _votes;
                if (_votes > 0) {
                    IBribe(external_bribes[gauges[_pool]])._withdraw(uint256(_votes), _tokenId);  // @audit gauges[pool] has been cleared and this will call address(0)
                    _totalWeight += _votes;
                } else {
                    _totalWeight -= _votes;
                }
                emit Abstained(_tokenId, _votes);
            }
        }
```

## Impact
User's `veNFT` permanently stuck. User's funds in the `veNFT` also permanently stuck.
