# Governance can permanently lock user voting power by removing gauges (`Voter::_vote`)

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Voter.sol` contract manages the allocation of voting power for users in a governance system. Users can vote for different gauges using their voting power, which is typically derived from locked tokens in a VotingEscrow contract. The [`_vote()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L249-L285) function is responsible for allocating this voting power to specified gauges.

A critical issue arises in the interaction between the [`_vote()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L249-L285) and [`_reset()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L207-L232) functions. When a user votes, the [`_vote()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L249-L285) function first calls [`_reset()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L207-L232) to clear previous votes before allocating new ones. However, the [`_reset()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L207-L232) function does not properly handle scenarios where a gauge has been removed after a user has voted for it.

The root cause of this issue lies in the [`_reset()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L207-L232) function:

```solidity
function _reset(uint _tokenId) internal {
    // ... (code omitted for brevity)
    for (uint i = 0; i < _poolVoteCnt; i ++) {
        address _pool = _poolVote[i];
        uint256 _votes = votes[_tokenId][_pool];

        if (_votes != 0) {
            _updateFor(gauges[_pool]);
            weights[_pool] -= _votes;
            votes[_tokenId][_pool] -= _votes;
            // ... (more code omitted)
        }
    }
    // ... (code omitted for brevity)
}
```

This function assumes that all gauges a user has voted for still exist. It doesn't check if `gauges[_pool]` is still a valid gauge before updating weights and votes.

The highest impact scenario occurs when governance removes a gauge that users have voted for. When these users attempt to reallocate their votes, the `_reset()` function fails to properly reset their voting power for the removed gauge. As a result, a portion of their voting power becomes permanently locked, reducing their overall influence in the governance system.

## Impact
Users can permanently lose a portion of their voting power if a gauge they voted for is removed by governance. This severely undermines the fairness and effectiveness of the governance system. Users who have lost voting power will have reduced influence in future governance decisions, potentially leading to skewed voting outcomes that don't accurately represent stakeholder interests. The impact is particularly severe because there's no mechanism for users to recover their lost voting power, making it a permanent reduction in their governance participation capabilities.

## Proof of Concept

1. Alice locks 100 tokens in the `VotingEscrow` contract, giving her 100 voting power.
2. Alice votes for Gauge A with all 100 of her voting power using `Voter::vote()`.
3. Governance decides to remove Gauge A using `Voter::killGaugeTotally()`.
4. Alice attempts to reallocate her votes to Gauge B using `Voter::vote()`.
5. Internally, `_vote()` calls `_reset()`.
6. `_reset()` fails to properly handle the removed Gauge A:
   - It attempts to call `_updateFor(gauges[_pool])` where `_pool` is Gauge A, but `gauges[_pool]` is now `address(0)`.
   - It fails to reset `votes[_tokenId][_pool]` for the removed gauge.
7. Alice's voting power remains allocated to the non-existent Gauge A, effectively reducing her total usable voting power to 0.
8. Alice is now unable to participate in governance decisions, despite still having locked tokens.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, the `_reset()` function should be modified to check if a gauge still exists before attempting to update weights and votes. Here's a suggested fix:

```diff
function _reset(uint _tokenId) internal {
    address[] storage _poolVote = poolVote[_tokenId];
    uint _poolVoteCnt = _poolVote.length;
    uint256 _totalWeight = 0;

    for (uint i = 0; i < _poolVoteCnt; i ++) {
        address _pool = _poolVote[i];
        uint256 _votes = votes[_tokenId][_pool];

        if (_votes != 0) {
+           address _gauge = gauges[_pool];
+           if (isGauge[_gauge]) {
                _updateFor(_gauge);
                weights[_pool] -= _votes;
                votes[_tokenId][_pool] -= _votes;
                if (_votes > 0) {
                    IBribe(external_bribes[_gauge])._withdraw(uint256(_votes), _tokenId);
                    _totalWeight += _votes;
                } else {
                    _totalWeight -= _votes;
                }
                emit Abstained(_tokenId, _votes);
+           } else {
+               // Handle removed gauge: reset votes without updating non-existent gauge
+               votes[_tokenId][_pool] = 0;
+               _totalWeight += _votes;
+               emit AbstainedFromRemovedGauge(_tokenId, _votes, _pool);
+           }
        }
    }
    totalWeight -= uint256(_totalWeight);
    usedWeights[_tokenId] = 0;
    delete poolVote[_tokenId];
}
```

This modification ensures that votes are properly reset even if the gauge has been removed, preventing the permanent loss of voting power. Additionally, it emits a new event to track when votes are reset for removed gauges, which can be useful for monitoring and auditing purposes.
