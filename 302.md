# Griefing/blocking when exercising oToken via `OptionTokenV4.exerciseVe()` call.

## Summary

A malicious user can force a revert on other users' calls to the `OptionTokenV4.exerciseVe()` function by frontrunning the call and delegating the maximum amount of veNFT tokens to them, causing the call to revert due to reaching the MAX_DELEGATES limit.

## Vulnerability Detail

Preconditions:
- `OptionTokenV4` allows only for calling `exerciseVe()` (`isExercisePaused == true`, `isExerciseLpPaused == true`, `isExerciseVePaused == false`).
- Some users have lots of oTokens for exercising.
- oTokens are soon to expire.

When a user calls `OptionTokenV4.exerciseVe()`, they exercise their oToken by adding liquidity to the Token/PayToken pair and then locking the LP tokens in the veNFT. During this process, a new veNFT is minted for the recipient of the `OptionTokenV4.exerciseVe()` call.

A malicious user can observe the mempool and frontrun these exercise transactions. They can split their veNFT into multiple smaller amounts, transfer the newly created veNFTs to a secondary address they control, and then delegate these veNFTs to the recipient of the `OptionTokenV4.exerciseVe()` call. 

If the total delegated amount of veNFT reaches the MAX_DELEGATES limit, a new token cannot be minted for the recipient, causing the `OptionTokenV4.exerciseVe()` call to revert.

This issue is particularly problematic if the oTokens have an expiration date, potentially leading to a loss of funds for the victim.

A similar problem of Denial of Service (DoS) can occur during standard calls to the `VotingEscrow.create_lock()`, `VotingEscrow.create_lock_for()`, and `VotingEscrow.split()` functions. However, in such cases, it is hard to prove the loss of funds. Yet, with the MAX_DELEGATES limit inside the VotingEscrow contract, the DoS problem is real.

## Impact

Denial of Service (DoS) and loss of funds for the affected user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding functionality for users to set themselves as non-delegatable addresses, thereby preventing anyone from delegating to such users.

Alternatively, remove the `recipient` parameter from the `OptionTokenV4.exerciseVe()` function and use `msg.sender` instead.
