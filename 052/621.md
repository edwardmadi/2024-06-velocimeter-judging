# Block split check can be easily bypassed

## Summary

Block split check can be easily bypassed. This is possible because when the NFT is transferred to another address, this check is set to `false`, and therefore, the user can send the NFT token to another address to reset the check.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `block_split` function in `VotingEscrow.sol` marks a specific token (NFT) as blocked from being split:

```solidity
    function block_split(uint _tokenId) external {
        assert(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));
        require(!blockedSplit[_tokenId],"blocked");

        blockedSplit[_tokenId] = true;
    }
```

The `blockedSplit` mapping can very easily be changed to false. What changes it is the `_transferFrom()` function, which is called by `transferFrom()`:

```solidity
blockedSplit[_tokenId] = false;
```

A user can very easily remove the blocking by simply sending the NFT to another address of his.
## Impact

Block split check can be easily bypassed.

## Recommendation

You can remove the `blockedSplit` mapping on NFT transfer, and add another function to remove the restriction.
