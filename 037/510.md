# Ownable GaugePlugin is not initialized with the owner

## Summary
The GaugePlugin contract inherits Openzeppelin's Ownable contract, but no owner has been assigned to it.

## Vulnerability Detail
The constructor function should also invoke the Ownable's constructor with the owner parameter, but it doesn't, so the contract's owner cannot be assigned the correct value.

## Impact
Owner-privileged functions cannot function as expected.
## Code Snippet
`contract GaugePlugin is IGaugePlugin, Ownable {
    address public governor; // credibly neutral party similar to Curve's Emergency DAO
    mapping(address => bool) public isWhitelistedForGaugeCreation; // token => whitelist for permissionless gauge creation

    constructor(address flow, address weth, address _governor) {
        governor = _governor;
        isWhitelistedForGaugeCreation[flow] = true;
        isWhitelistedForGaugeCreation[weth] = true;
    }`
