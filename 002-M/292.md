# Rounding errors in the `_k()` calculation for stable pairs can allow an attacker to drain all tokens from the pair.

## Summary

This is a known issue with stable pools that use the `x3y + y3x >= k` formula. It was discovered during the Velodrome protocol audit [link](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/raw/master/pdfs/Velodrome-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf), but the issue is still present in the Velocimeter code.

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to drain all tokens from the pool. In the `Pair.sol` contract, a stable curve formula `x3y + y3x >= k` is used when the pool is created with the stable parameter set to true.

```solidity
File: Pair.sol
403:     function _k(uint x, uint y) internal view returns (uint) {
404:         if (stable) {
405:             uint _x = x * 1e18 / decimals0;
406:             uint _y = y * 1e18 / decimals1;
407:             uint _a = (_x * _y) / 1e18;
408:             uint _b = ((_x * _x) / 1e18 + (_y * _y) / 1e18);
409:             return _a * _b / 1e18;  // x3y + y3x >= k
410:         } else {
411:             return x * y; // xy >= k
412:         }
413:     }
```

In the above formula, if the value `x * y <= 1e18`, a rounding error occurs. This can happen during the first liquidity provision when the provided liquidity is small.

This error results in an incorrect and successful validation of the product constants within the `swap()` function, where `_k()` for reserves will be 0:

```solidity
File: Pair.sol
328:         // The curve, either x3y + y3x for stable pools, or x*y for volatile pools
329:         require(_k(_balance0, _balance1) >= _k(_reserve0, _reserve1), 'K'); // Pair: K
```

## Impact

The rounding error can lead to the invariant k of stable pools equaling zero, allowing the attacker to steal whatever is left in the pool.
