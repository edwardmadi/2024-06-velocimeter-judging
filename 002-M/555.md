# First liquidity provider of a stable pair can DOS the pool


## Summary
The invariant `k` of a stable pool can be manipulated due to rounding errors in its calculation, allowing the first liquidity provider to repeatedly drain the pool and cause a denial of service (DOS).

## Vulnerability Detail
The invariant k of a stable pool is calculated as follows in Pair.sol#L403:
`_k = (x * y) / 1e18;`
When `x * y < 1e18`, `_k` becomes zero due to rounding errors. 
This allows the first liquidity provider to:
- Mint a small amount of liquidity to the pool.
- Drain the pool.
- Repeat steps 1 and 2, causing the overflow of the total supply.
The mint function includes a minimum liquidity check of `sqrt(a * b) > MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY`.
However, this is not sufficient to protect the invariant formula of stable pools from rounding errors.

## Impact
The rounding error leads to the invariant `k` of stable pools equaling zero, enabling a trader to drain the pool repeatedly. This effectively causes a denial of service (DOS) attack on the pool, preventing other users from participating and potentially leading to loss of assets.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent this issue, implement the following restrictions on the first liquidity provider of stable pools:
- Only allow equal amounts of liquidity to be added.
- Ensure the invariant `_k` is larger than `MINIMUM_K`.
