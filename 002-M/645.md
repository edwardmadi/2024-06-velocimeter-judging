# First liquidity provider of a stable pair can DOS the pool

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The invariant k of a stable pool is calculated as follows :

```solidity
function _k(uint256 x, uint256 y) internal view returns (uint256) {
          if (stable) {
               uint256 _x = (x * 1e18) / decimals0;
               uint256 _y = (y * 1e18) / decimals1;
               uint256 _a = (_x * _y) / 1e18;
               uint256 _b = ((_x * _x) / 1e18 + (_y * _y) / 1e18);
               return (_a * _b) / 1e18; // x3y+y3x >= k
        } else {
              return x * y; // xy >= k
        }
}
```

The value of _a = (x * y ) / 1e18 = 0 due to rounding error when x*y < 1e18. The rounding error can lead to
the invariant k of stable pools equals zero, and the trader can steal whatever is left in the pool.

The first liquidity provider can DOS the pair by: 1.mint a small amount of liquidity to the pool, 2. Steal whatever is
left in the pool, 3. Repeat step 1, and step 2 until the overflow of the total supply.

To prevent the issue of rounding error, the reserve of a pool should never go too small. The mint function which was
borrowed from uniswapV2 has a minimum liquidity check of sqrt(a * b) > MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY; This, however,
isn't safe enough to protect the invariant formula of stable pools.

## Impact
A liquidity pool can be DOS'ed by first liquidity provider.

## Recommendation
Add a check in mint() function that invariant _k should be larger than the MINIMUM_K
