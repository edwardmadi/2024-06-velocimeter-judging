# First liquidity provider of a stable pair can DOS the pool

## Summary
In pair.sol, The invariant k of a stable pool formula has rounding error when small amount, the rounding error can lead to the invariant k of stable pools equals zero, and the trader can steal whatever is left in the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
The invariant k of a stable pool is calculated as follows `Pair.sol`
```solidity
function _k(uint256 x, uint256 y) internal view returns (uint256) {
  if (stable) {
    uint256 _x = (x * 1e18) / decimals0;
    uint256 _y = (y * 1e18) / decimals1;
    uint256 _a = (_x * _y) / 1e18;
    uint256 _b = ((_x * _x) / 1e18 + (_y * _y) / 1e18);
    return (_a * _b) / 1e18; // x3y+y3x >= k
  } else {
    return x * y; // xy >= k
  }
}
```
The value of _a = (x * y ) / 1e18 = 0 due to rounding error when x*y < 1e18. The rounding error can lead to the invariant k of stable pools equals zero, and the trader can steal whatever is left in the pool. The first liquidity provider can DOS the pair by: 1.mint a small amount of liquidity to the pool, 2. Steal whatever is left in the pool, 3. Repeat step 1, and step 2 until the overflow of the total supply.

```solidity
// this low-level function should be called from a contract which performs important safety checks
function swap(uint amount0Out, uint amount1Out, address to, bytes calldata data) external lock {
   ...
    // The curve, either x3y+y3x for stable pools, or x*y for volatile pools
>>    require(_k(_balance0, _balance1) >= _k(_reserve0, _reserve1), 'K'); // Pair: K
    ...
    _balance0 = IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this)); 
    _balance1 = IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this));
    _update(_balance0, _balance1, _reserve0, _reserve1);
    emit Swap(msg.sender, amount0In, amount1In, amount0Out, amount1Out, to);
}
```

In swap function, it will check _k(_balance0, _balance1) >= _k(_reserve0, _reserve1), so small amounts swap is always possible.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent the issue of rounding error, the reserve of a pool should never go too small. The mint function which was borrowed from uniswapV2 has a minimum liquidity check of sqrt(a * b) > MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY; Recommend to add restriction on the first lp of stable pools:  `invariant _k` should be larger than the `MINIMUM_K`.
