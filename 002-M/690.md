# First liquidity provider of a stable pair can DOS the pool

## Summary
The _k function in stable pools is vulnerable to rounding errors when calculating the invariant k. This can lead to a situation where k becomes zero, allowing malicious actors to drain the pool. Additionally, the current minimum liquidity check is insufficient to protect stable pools from this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Detail

The invariant `k` of a stable pool is calculated as follows:

```js
    function _k(uint x, uint y) internal view returns (uint) {
        if (stable) {
            uint _x = x * 1e18 / decimals0;
            uint _y = y * 1e18 / decimals1;
            uint _a = (_x * _y) / 1e18;
            uint _b = ((_x * _x) / 1e18 + (_y * _y) / 1e18);
            return _a * _b / 1e18;  // x3y+y3x >= k
        } else {
            return x * y; // xy >= k
        }
    }
```
The value of _a = (x * y ) / 1e18 = 0 due to rounding error when x*y < 1e18. The rounding error can lead to
the invariant k of stable pools equals zero, and the trader can steal whatever is left in the pool.
The first liquidity provider can DOS the pair by: 
1.mint a small amount of liquidity to the pool, 
2. Steal whatever is left in the pool, 
4. Repeat step 1, and step 2 until the overflow of the total supply

The current minimum liquidity check, borrowed from Uniswap V2, is insufficient:


```js
              ....snip.....
        uint _amount0 = _balance0 - _reserve0;
        uint _amount1 = _balance1 - _reserve1;
        uint _totalSupply = totalSupply; // gas savings, must be defined here since totalSupply can update in _mintFee
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            liquidity = Math.sqrt(_amount0 * _amount1) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
            _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); // permanently lock the first MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY tokens
         ......snip......
```



## Impact

Potential complete drainage of stable pools
Disruption of pool functionality

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend to add two restrictions on the first lp of stable pools:
1. only allows equal amounts of liquidity.
2. invariant _k should be larger than the MINIMUM_K
