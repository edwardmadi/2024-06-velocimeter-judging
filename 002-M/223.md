# First liquidity provider of a stable pair can DoS the pool

## Summary
First liquidity provider of a stable pair can DoS the pool

## Vulnerability Detail
The invariant `_k ` is as follows  for stable pairs: 
```solidity
    function _k(uint x, uint y) internal view returns (uint) {
        if (stable) {
            uint _x = x * 1e18 / decimals0;
            uint _y = y * 1e18 / decimals1;
            uint _a = (_x * _y) / 1e18;
            uint _b = ((_x * _x) / 1e18 + (_y * _y) / 1e18);
            return _a * _b / 1e18;  // x3y+y3x >= k
```

In case of really low values of `_x` and `_y`, `_a` can get rounded down to 0 (and hence `_k` will equal 0 too).

When `_k` is 0, user can swap out all of the funds out of the pair as the check at the end of swap will always pass
```solidity
        require(_k(_balance0, _balance1) >= _k(_reserve0, _reserve1), 'K'); // Pair: K
```

A user could use this to brick the pool in the following way:
1. Mint dust amount of LP, such that `_a` round downs to 0.
2. Because `_k` is 0, move all funds out of the contract.
3. Repeat steps and 1. and 2. By doing so, LP's value will get inflated each time.
4. Inflate LP's value so much that any attempt to further mint ``LP`  results in DoS due to overflow

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a minimum `_k` requirement on the first LP mint
