# No mechanism is implemented to withdraw accured fees in Voting Escrow & Gauge

## Summary
Lack of fee withdrawal functionality in Voting Escrow & Gauge contracts disincentivizes users from locking their LP tokens, potentially leading to locked fees and reduced governance participation.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users are required to lock  LP tokens in the Voting Escrow contract to obtain `veBVM` tokens and participate in governance voting. However, by doing so, they forfeit the ability to collect fees generated from the corresponding pool.

This results in fees accumulating in Voting Escrow & Guage contracts with no mechanism for users to access them, potentially disincentivizing users from locking their LP tokens.

## Impact
This issue can lead to a significant portion of fees being locked in the Voting Escrow contract, inaccessible to users. It disincentivizes participation in the voting system.
