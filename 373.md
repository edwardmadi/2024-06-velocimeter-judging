# Reentrancy in TransferFrom, Mint, and Burn Functions in Flow Contracts

## Summary
The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks on the `transferFrom`, `mint`, and `burn` functions. This attack allows an attacker to exploit a contract so as to spend, mint, or burn more tokens than permitted in a single transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_to` variable in the `transferFrom` function, the `account` variable in the `mint` function, and the `msg.sender` variable in the `burn` function can be contract addresses. they can potentially exploit reentrancy vulnerabilities by calling back into the contract before the state changes are finalized.

## Impact
- potential double spend or unauthorized transfer.
- Unauthorized minting of tokens.
- Unauthorized burning of tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `ReentrancyGuard`: Implement OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrancy in vulnerable functions.
