# `ownerOf()` implementation non-ERC721 compliant

## Summary
The ERC721 standard requires that ownership queries for NFTs assigned to the zero address must revert, indicating invalid/non-existent NFT. However, the `VotingEscrow.ownerOf()` implementation  returns address(0) instead, violating this standard. This deviation risks causing functional and security issue.
## Vulnerability Detail
`VotingEscrow.ownerOf()` implementation  returns address(0) instead, violating this standard
```solidity
    function ownerOf(uint _tokenId) public view returns (address) {
        return idToOwner[_tokenId];
    }
```
For a non-existent `_tokenId`, this implementation will return address(0) instead of reverting. This behavior is not compliant with the ERC721 specification.

## Impact
This non-compliance can lead to serious compatibility issues with external integrations that rely on standard ERC721 behavior. Applications expecting a revert when querying ownership of an invalid NFT might instead receive a non-reverting response, potentially resulting in erroneous processing or security vulnerabilities in syste
