# Unsafe casting in `RewardsDistributorV2` leads to underflow of `ve_for_at`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L134

## Summary
In the `RewardsDistributorV2` contract, casting a negative number to uint results in an underflow to a large number. This occurs when calculating the balance of a token at a specific time, leading to incorrect reward distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail
Solidity does not revert when casting a negative number to uint. Instead, it underflows to a large
number. In the `RewardDistributorV2` contract, the balance of a token at specific time is calculated as follows

```javascript
IVotingEscrow.Point memory pt = IVotingEscrow(ve).user_point_history(_tokenId, epoch);
        return Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * (int128(int256(_timestamp - pt.ts))))), 0);
```
This supposes to return zero when the calculated balance is a negative number. However, it underflows to a large
number. This would lead to incorrect reward distribution.

## POC

* A user creates a lock on a token, generating an initial bias and slope.
* Time progresses, and the bias decreases while the slope remains constant.
* At a specific timestamp _timestamp, the bias becomes less than the product of the slope and the time difference `(_timestamp - pt.ts)`.
* When calculating the balance at this time, the formula `pt.bias - pt.slope * (int128(int256(_timestamp - pt.ts)))` results in a negative number.
* The negative result is cast to uint, causing an underflow to a large number.
* Due to the underflow, the balance is incorrectly calculated as a large number.
* This leads to the user receiving an excessively large amount of rewards.

## Impact
The incorrect calculation caused by underflow can result in users receiving excessively large rewards

## Code Snippet

```javascript
 function ve_for_at(uint _tokenId, uint _timestamp) external view returns (uint) {
        address ve = voting_escrow;
        uint max_user_epoch = IVotingEscrow(ve).user_point_epoch(_tokenId);
        uint epoch = _find_timestamp_user_epoch(ve, _tokenId, _timestamp, max_user_epoch);
        IVotingEscrow.Point memory pt = IVotingEscrow(ve).user_point_history(_tokenId, epoch);
        return Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * (int128(int256(_timestamp - pt.ts))))), 0);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Return zero for a negative number.

```javascript
int256 result = int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * int128(int256(_timestamp - pt.ts)));
if (result < 0) return 0;
return uint256(result);
```
