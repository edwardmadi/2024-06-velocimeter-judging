# Unsafe casting in RewardsDistributorv2 may unfairly affect accounting, increase users rewards and brick protocol

## Summary
The `_claim` function is designed to calculate and distribute rewards to a user based on their token holdings in a voting escrow system. P.S. This is one simple elaboration, other functions do use the same method which result in overflow into a large integer.  (Check Code Snippets)

## Vulnerability Detail
Solidity does not revert when casting a negative number to `uint`; instead, it underflows to a large positive value. In the `RewardDistributorv2` contract, the balance of a token at a specific time is calculated. Balance should return zero when the calculated balance is a negative number. However, it underflows to a large number.

```solidity
    function _claim(uint _tokenId, address ve, uint _last_token_time) internal returns (uint) {
    -- SNIP --
                int128 dt = int128(int256(week_cursor - old_user_point.ts));
                uint balance_of = Math.max(uint(int256(old_user_point.bias - dt * old_user_point.slope)), 0); //@audit-issue
                if (balance_of == 0 && user_epoch > max_user_epoch) break;
                if (balance_of != 0) {
                    to_distribute += balance_of * tokens_per_week[week_cursor] / ve_supply[week_cursor];
                }
    -- SNIP --
```
Example Scenario:
```solidity
old_user_point.bias = 10
dt = 20
old_user_point.slope = 1
```
The calculation as follows:
```solidity
old_user_point.bias - dt * old_user_point.slope
= 10 - (20 * 1)
= 10 - 20
= -10
```
Result Overflow Casting:
When you cast -10 to uint:

```solidity
uint balance_of = Math.max(uint(int256(-10)), 0);
// This results in an underflow, and uint(int256(-10)) becomes a very large number (specifically 2^256 - 10)
```

Furthermore there are many more unsafe casting within the protocol from converting int256 to int128. 

## Impact
An integer overflow may result in unfair rewards claimed and accounting involved. It is also possible that if the rewards in contract is insufficient, claiming is impossible, hence bricking the protocol.

## Recommendation
Do ensure the mentioned LoC in code snippets follow the same recommendation and include OpenZepplin SafeCast for `int(128(int256))`: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/utils#SafeCast
