# Options will be impossible to be exercised in case `maxLPDiscount == minLPDiscount`

## Summary
Options will be impossible to be exercised in case `maxLPDiscount == minLPDiscount`

## Vulnerability Detail
When calculating the slope and intercept for the discount, the following calculation is used
```solidity
    function getSlopeInterceptForLpDiscount()
        public
        view
        returns (int256 slope, int256 intercept)
    {
        slope =
            int256(lockDurationForMaxLpDiscount - lockDurationForMinLpDiscount) /
            (int256(maxLPDiscount) - int256(minLPDiscount));
        intercept = int256(lockDurationForMinLpDiscount) - (slope * int256(minLPDiscount));
    }
```

The problem arises in the situation where `maxLPDiscount == minLPDiscount`. Then, division by 0 will occur and transactions will revert. No options will be possible to be exercised into LP/ve.

## Recommendation
If `maxLPDiscount == minLPDiscount`, return `slope == 1` and `intercept == 0`.
