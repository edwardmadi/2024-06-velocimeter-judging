# Incorrect Team Emissions Calculation

## Summary
The Minter contract calculates team emissions using the weekly emission rate, which may not accurately reflect the current week's total emission, potentially leading to incorrect team emission allocations.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the update_period function, team emissions are calculated as follows:
```solidity
uint _teamEmissions = (teamRate * weekly) / (PRECISION - teamRate);
```
This calculation uses weekly, which is derived from weekly_emission(). However, this may not accurately represent the total emissions for the current week, as it doesn't account for any growth or additional emissions that might occur.

## Impact
The team may receive fewer emissions than intended, as the calculation doesn't consider the total emissions for the current period. This could lead to:
* Underpayment of team emissions
* Inconsistency between intended and actual emission distributions
* Potential imbalance in the tokenomics of the system

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
* Calculate the total emissions for the current period, including any growth or additional emissions.
* Use this total emission value to calculate team emissions.
* Simplify the calculation by using PRECISION as the denominator instead of (PRECISION - teamRate).
```solidity
function update_period() external returns (uint) {
    // ... (previous code)
    uint256 weekly = weekly_emission();
    uint256 growth = calculate_growth(weekly); // Implement this function to calculate additional growth
    uint256 totalEmission = weekly + growth;

    uint _teamEmissions = (teamRate * totalEmission) / PRECISION;
    uint _required = totalEmission + _teamEmissions;
    // ... (rest of the function)
}
```
