# The update_period function only accounts for 1 week worth of emissions

## Summary
If the update_period function at the Minter contract is called after waiting longer than a week since the last call, the emissions are only accounted for a whole week and not for the time it hasn't been called.
## Vulnerability Detail
The update_period function can only be called weekly. It serves to accrue team emissions and notify reward amounts to the voter contract.
The issue with this function lies on the non-varying amount of emissions.
Here the code checks if more than a week has passed since the last week-rounded update has been made and sets the new active_period to compute the requirements for the next succesful update_period call:
```solidity
uint _period = active_period;
        if (block.timestamp >= _period + WEEK && initializer == address(0)) { // only trigger if new week
            _period = (block.timestamp / WEEK) * WEEK;
            active_period = _period;
```

Then it calculates the emissions and sends them to the team and to the voter:
```solidity
uint256 weekly = weekly_emission();
uint _teamEmissions = (teamRate * weekly) /
                (PRECISION - teamRate);
uint _required =  weekly + _teamEmissions;
uint _balanceOf = _flow.balanceOf(address(this));
if (_balanceOf < _required) {
    _flow.mint(address(this), _required - _balanceOf);
}

require(_flow.transfer(teamEmissions, _teamEmissions));

_checkpointRewardsDistributors();

_flow.approve(address(_voter), weekly);
_voter.notifyRewardAmount(weekly);
```

The issue on this function is at the line that assigns the amount of emissions as the weekly_emission. 
Notice it doesn't take into account how much time has passed since the last update has been succesfully processed. Therefore, if two weeks have gone by since the last call, it will still accrue emissions worth 1 week.
## Impact
The update_period function does not send the correct amount of emissions if two weeks or more have passed since the last successful call.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Make sure to calculate the weekly uint256 variable in function of how much time has passed since the last active period. The following implementation is a suggestion on how to reorder the operations:
```solidity
 function update_period() external returns (uint) {
        uint _period = active_period;
        if (block.timestamp >= _period + WEEK && initializer == address(0)) { // only trigger if new week
		    // @audit rounding down here is fine.
		    uint256 weeks_passed = (block.timestamp - _period) / WEEK;
            _period = (block.timestamp / WEEK) * WEEK;
            active_period = _period;
            uint256 weekly = weeks_passed * weekly_emission();
```
