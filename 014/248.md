# Team receives more emissions than they should each cycle

## Summary

Because of a wrong calculation, the team receives more tokens each cycle than they should causing the total supply of FLOW to be inflated.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Minter calculates the team's emissions as:
```sol
uint _teamEmissions = (teamRate * weekly) / (PRECISION - teamRate);
```
Where `PRECISION = 1000` and `teamRate = 50`. So the team's emissions should be 5% of the total amount of FLOW that's distributed that week. Given that 1e18 FLOW is distributed that week, we get: $50 * 1e18 / (1000 - 50) = 5.2631579e16$ which is slightly more than 5%.

## Impact
The team receives more FLOW than they should each cycle which inflates the total supply of FLOW.
