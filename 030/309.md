# Lack of access control on the `Voter.emitWithdraw()` function.

## Summary

There is no access control on the `Voter.emitWithdraw()` function, allowing anyone to emit the `Withdraw` event with any values. This compromises the reliability of any indexer or external system relying on this event.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `emitWithdraw()` function allows unrestricted emission of the `Withdraw` event:

```solidity
File: Voter.sol
449:     function emitWithdraw(uint tokenId, address account, uint amount) external { // <=== anyone can emit Withdraw leading to using Withdrawal emit as useless for external indexers
450:         emit Withdraw(account, msg.sender, tokenId, amount);
451:     }
```

Since there are no access controls, any user can emit false `Withdraw` events, rendering the event data unreliable for external indexers and systems.

## Impact

The function becomes useless in the system, and the `Withdraw` event emission cannot be trusted by external systems.
