# `withdraw` and `merge` will not work for approved addresses, although they should.

## Summary
`withdraw` and `merge` will not work for approved addresses, although they should.

## Vulnerability Detail
If we look at `withdraw`, we'll see that it requires that the `msg.sender` is either approved or owner.
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint _tokenId) external nonreentrant {
        assert(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));
        require(attachments[_tokenId] == 0 && !voted[_tokenId], "attached");
```

However, simply approved addresses will not actually be able to withdraw the token.

This is because within `_burn`, `approve` is called 
```solidity
    function _burn(uint _tokenId) internal {
        require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId), "caller is not owner nor approved");

        address tokenOwner = ownerOf(_tokenId);

        // Clear approval
        approve(address(0), _tokenId);
        // checkpoint for gov
        _moveTokenDelegates(delegates(tokenOwner), address(0), _tokenId);
        // Remove token
        _removeTokenFrom(tokenOwner, _tokenId);
        emit Transfer(tokenOwner, address(0), _tokenId);
    }
```

And `approve` requires `msg.sender` to be either the owner or approved for all (therefore, a simply approved user will not be able to invoke it) 
```solidity
    function approve(address _approved, uint _tokenId) public {
        address tokenOwner = idToOwner[_tokenId];
        // Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT
        require(tokenOwner != address(0));
        // Throws if `_approved` is the current owner
        require(_approved != tokenOwner);
        // Check requirements
        bool senderIsOwner = (idToOwner[_tokenId] == msg.sender);
        bool senderIsApprovedForAll = (ownerToOperators[tokenOwner])[msg.sender];
        require(senderIsOwner || senderIsApprovedForAll);
        // Set the approval
        idToApprovals[_tokenId] = _approved;
        emit Approval(tokenOwner, _approved, _tokenId);
    }
```

Same issue occurs when trying to merge a `veNFT`.

## Recommendation
Instead of calling `approve`, simply clear the value of `idToApprovals[_tokenId] `
