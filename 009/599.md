# Approved addresses cannot merge or withdraw from veLP NFTs because of conflicting checks

## Summary
The protocol intends to allow approved addresses to do many things on behalf of a veLP NFT owner. All other functions work properly, but merge and withdraw will always revert if called by an approved address.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lets take the example of merge. [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L1198), the ```isApprovedOrOwner()``` checks make sure that the 'from' tokenID and 'to' tokenID are both either approved to/ or owned by the caller.

In this merge flow, it later calls ```_burn()```. This is the burn function : 

```solidity
    function _burn(uint _tokenId) internal {
        require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId), "caller is not owner nor approved");

        address tokenOwner = ownerOf(_tokenId);

        approve(address(0), _tokenId);  <- @audit

        _moveTokenDelegates(delegates(tokenOwner), address(0), _tokenId);
        _removeTokenFrom(tokenOwner, _tokenId);
        emit Transfer(tokenOwner, address(0), _tokenId);
    }
```

The relevant part here is the approve() function. 
```solidity
    function approve(address _approved, uint _tokenId) public {
        address tokenOwner = idToOwner[_tokenId];
        require(tokenOwner != address(0));
        require(_approved != tokenOwner);

        bool senderIsOwner = (idToOwner[_tokenId] == msg.sender);
        bool senderIsApprovedForAll = (ownerToOperators[tokenOwner])[msg.sender];
        require(senderIsOwner || senderIsApprovedForAll);

        idToApprovals[_tokenId] = _approved;
        emit Approval(tokenOwner, _approved, _tokenId);
    }
```

This logic never checks if the msg.sender is an approved address for the tokenID, using ```idToApprovals[tokenID]```. This will revert if called by the approved address, but that is incorrect because the intention is clearly to allow an approved address to use these functions, as seen with the logic of [isApprovedorOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L300) which is used in the merge and withdraw functions' access control checks. 

## Impact
Approved addresses will not be able to access merge() and withdraw() functions.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the ```_burn()``` function use ```_clearApproval()``` in place of approve().
