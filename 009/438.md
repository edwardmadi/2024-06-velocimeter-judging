# `VotingEscrow.merge` will revert if `msg.sender == spenderIsApproved`

## Summary
Impact: Tokens cannot be merged with a single token approval because it reverts on `_burn`. 
Root casue: `approve(address(0), _tokenId)` used which has unnecessary further checks instead of direct `idToApprovals[_tokenId] = address(0)`

## Vulnerability Detail
**Issue flow :**

1. Token 8 has to be merged with token 10. And both users have approved their particular tokens to the protocol dapp or a frontend client operator address.
2. Now the dapp got approval, so it tries to merge, but it will revert causing permanent DOS due to revert in `_burn`
3. so the call flow, dapp calls `merge` ==> merge checks if caller is either owner or that token is approved or all tokens are approved in lines 1206, 1207 and 305. 
4. so either owner / token 8 approved / all tokens operator approved. Here case is token 8 is only approved, so dapp tries to merge, and on Line 1216 `_burn` is called and in Line 547 in burn, `approve(address(0), _tokenId)` is done, which again checks if caller is either owner or operator approved for all tokens in line 261 but reverts if caller only has that particular token approved.
5. in line 261 is where it will revert, and its an issue because user wants to give only approval to particular token and doesn't want to give operator approval for all, because it might be risky or he might gave operator approval to oher dapp and giving it here will erase it and token sale might stop there for other tokens, so he will give approval for only token 8 and the check in line 1206 allows it. But the check in line 261 will revert this. 
6. So this is an issue with medium dos and likelihood as mentioned in point 5 before.

## Impact
Impact: Tokens cannot be merged with a single token approval because it reverts on `_burn`. 

Likelihood of user giving 1 token approval is also high : User wants to give only approval to particular token and doesn't want to give operator approval for all, because 
1. he might gave operator approval to another dapp and giving it here will erase it and token sale might stop there for other tokens, 
2. it might be risky to give all token operators approval and revoking flow is difficult because he has to revoke.cash / etherscan to revoke. So in these cases, he will give approval for only that particular token.

        // Clear approval
