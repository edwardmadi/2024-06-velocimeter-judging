Agreeable Shadow Parakeet

# Users who have been approved for a single token ID cannot withdraw or merge for that token ID.

## Summary
Users approved for a single token id cannot `withdraw` or `merge` for that token id.
## Vulnerability Detail
Both `withdraw` and `merge` check if the msg.sender is owner of the given token id or is approved to use it (either for all tokens from the same owner of specifically the one being used).

They will also burn the token after carrying on their logic and clear its approvals.

Approvals are cleared using approve(address(0), _tokenId) which will fail if a msg.sender is only approved for that token id specifically.

## Impact
User approved for a single token cannot withdraw or merge.
 Users need to give permission for all their tokens to another user when they want that user to carry withdraw or merge operations for them.
