# Expired locks can be used to claim Rewards

## Summary
Expired locks can be used to claim Rewards

## Vulnerability Detail
Expired locks can keep claiming rewards for any bribe. This will lead to a theft of rewards.
This is because there is no check in place to verify if the lock has expired before claiming rewards. This allows malicious users to use expired locks to claim rewards.

As seen below, `LockedBalance.end` is not checked to ensure that the lock hasn't expired before claiming rewards. [Voter.sol#L542-L547](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L542-L547).
```solidity
    function claimBribes(address[] memory _bribes, address[][] memory _tokens, uint _tokenId) external {
        require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId));
        for (uint i = 0; i < _bribes.length; i++) {
            IBribe(_bribes[i]).getRewardForOwner(_tokenId, _tokens[i]);
        }
    }
```
