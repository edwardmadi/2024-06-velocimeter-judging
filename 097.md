# Not enough protection from MEV during zapping of liquidity

## Summary
Lack of slippage due to deadline no `amountMinimum`  check

## Vulnerability Detail
Velocimeter while zapping liquidty uses the addliquidity function from [uniswapv2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Router.sol#L199), which takes in several args among which some of them are deadline, amtAmin/amtBmin.
The problem is while adding liquidity velocimeter sets deadline as block.timestamp as deadline which is not ideal but that is not the point of concern since it already sets deadline [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter-Saptarshi1010/blame/c960973f85bb27be6428b17d61a76965b618a761/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L293) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter-Saptarshi1010/blame/c960973f85bb27be6428b17d61a76965b618a761/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L312)

But in uniswap also checks the` minAmount` desired which bounds the `Amountdesired` upto a certain point, which the protocol sets to 1 in both the input cases
So, User's who want to exercise their option token can do by calling  `exerciseLP/exerciseVe` 
This can be sandwiched by a MEV easily .A MEV bot detects the pending transaction. Since the outdated maximum slippage value now allows for high slippage, the bot sandwiches a user, resulting in significant profit for the bot and significant loss for the user.

## Impact
Thus meaning a user could see less amount minted than their exact amount.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the particular lines ::
```solidity
(, , lpAmount) = IRouter(router).addLiquidity(
            underlyingToken,
            paymentToken,
            false,
            _amount,
            paymentAmountToAddLiquidity,
 --  1,
++ amountAMin
 --           1,
++ amountBMin
            address(this),
            block.timestamp
```
