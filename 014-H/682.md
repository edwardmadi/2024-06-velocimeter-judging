# rewards are lost when merging and withdrawing tokens because the rewards are not claimed before burning the token

## Summary
rewards are lost when merging or withdrawing tokens because the rewards are not claimed before burning the token.

## Vulnerability Detail
Merging or withdrawing tokens requires burning the token.  When merging or withdrawing tokens, unclaimed rewards must be claimed before burning the token. This prevents users from losing their rewards when the tokens are burnt. This isn't the case however as unclaimed rewards are not claimed before burning the token. This makes the user's unclaimed rewards to become lost and unclaimable when the tokens are burnt.

Hence, users will lose their rewards when merging or withdrawing tokens because the rewards are not claimed before burning the token. This leads to a permanent freezing of unclaimed rewards as the rewards are lost and unclaimable. 

## Impact
Permanent freezing of unclaimed rewards
