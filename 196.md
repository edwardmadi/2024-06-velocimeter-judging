# Users cannot deposit more than once using different NFTs.

## Summary
Users cannot deposit more than once using different NFTs.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `GuageV4` contract, when users call the deposit function with an NFT, they can't deposit again with a different NFT. This issue arises from the code [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/GaugeV4.sol#L483), which checks that the previous NFT's token ID matches the current one being deposited.

The team confirmed that this is not the intended design. Users should be able to deposit multiple times, with or without  NFTs.

## Impact
Users cannot deposit more than once using different NFTs.

```diff 

        if (tokenId > 0) {
            require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).ownerOf(tokenId) == account);
            if (tokenIds[account] == 0) {
                tokenIds[account] = tokenId;
                IVoter(voter).attachTokenToGauge(tokenId, account);
            }
-            require(tokenIds[account] == tokenId);
        } else {
            tokenId = tokenIds[account];
        }
```
