# `MAX_FEES` is not enforced in optionTokenV4 contract

## Summary
`MAX_FEES` is the maximum percentage of fees allowed to take from user payment. In the code, `MAX_FEES` is set to 50, meaning that maximum only 50% of user payment will go to fee.

The problem is that `MAX_FEES` is not respected when adding or replacing treasuries, leading to the fact that users will have to pay more than `MAX_FEES` (50%) in some certain cases.
## Vulnerability Detail
`MAX_FEES` is set to 50%
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_FEES = 50;
```

However, in treasury management functions, such as addTreasury() and replaceTreasury(), there is currently no check if the total percentage of fees exceeds `MAX_FEES`.

```solidity
    function addTreasury(TreasuryConfig calldata _treasury) external onlyAdmin {
        require(_treasury.treasury != address(0), 'addr 0');
        treasurys.push(_treasury);

        emit AddTreasury(_treasury.treasury, _treasury.fee, _treasury.notify);
    }

    function replaceTreasury(TreasuryConfig calldata _treasury,uint256 _pos) external onlyAdmin{
        require(_treasury.treasury != address(0), 'addr 0');
        require(_pos < treasurys.length, '_pos out of range');
        treasurys[_pos] = _treasury;
    }
```
## Impact
Users might have to pay for fees much more than intended.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check which will revert when fees from treasuries take more than `MAX_FEES` of user payment into addTreasury() and replaceTreasury().
