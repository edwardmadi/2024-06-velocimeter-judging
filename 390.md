## Summary
The onlyMinter modifier incorrectly requires both ADMIN_ROLE and MINTER_ROLE for minting, instead of either.
The constructor does not grant the MINTER_ROLE to any account, making the mint function inaccessible.
This results in function reverts, preventing token minting.

## Vulnerability Detail
The role management system in the contract has potential issues in the `onlyMinter` modifier and constructor. These issues affect who can mint tokens and may lead to function reverts.

Proof of Concept:

The `onlyMinter` modifier currently requires that the caller has both `ADMIN_ROLE` && `MINTER_ROLE` to pass the check. This is incorrect as it should allow access if the caller has either role.

Current Logic:

```javascript
if (
    !hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender) &&
    !hasRole(MINTER_ROLE, msg.sender)
) revert OptionToken_NoMinterRole();

```

What this means is that the caller should have both the `ADMIN_ROLE` && `MINTER_ROLE`

The other issue we have here is Missing `MINTER_ROLE` in Constructor, from our constructor we can see that the `MINTER_ROLE` is never set so that means that there will be no way for the `onlyMinter` modifier check to pass because if the minter is not set there is no way a caller will have both `ADMIN_ROLE` and `MINTER_ROLE`, this means that the function mint will never work.

constructor logic

```javascript
constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _admin,
        address _underlyingToken,
        address _treasury,
        address _voter,
        address _router,
        bool _isExerciseLpPaused,
        bool _isExerciseVePaused,
        bool _isExercisePaused,
        uint256 _expiryCooldownTime
    ) ERC20(_name, _symbol, 18) {
        _grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, _admin);
        _grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, _admin);
        _setRoleAdmin(ADMIN_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
        _setRoleAdmin(MINTER_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
        _setRoleAdmin(PAUSER_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
        //
    }
```

If `MINTER_ROLE` is missing and only `ADMIN_ROLE` is granted, the mint function will be inaccessible because the `onlyMinter` modifier incorrectly enforces that both ADMIN_ROLE and MINTER_ROLE are required.

```javascript
/// @notice Called by the admin to mint options tokens. Admin must grant token approval.
    /// @param _to The address that will receive the minted options tokens
    /// @param _amount The amount of options tokens that will be minted
    function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyMinter {
        // transfer underlying tokens from the caller
        _safeTransferFrom(underlyingToken, msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
        // mint options tokens
        _mint(_to, _amount);
    }
```

so no account will have the ability to mint tokens.

## Impact
Without the MINTER_ROLE being granted in the constructor, no account will have the permission to mint tokens, rendering the mint function unusable.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
 function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyMinter {
        // transfer underlying tokens from the caller
        _safeTransferFrom(underlyingToken, msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
        // mint options tokens
        _mint(_to, _amount);
    }
```
Constructor
```javascript
   constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _admin,
        address _underlyingToken,
        address _treasury,
        address _voter,
        address _router,
        bool _isExerciseLpPaused,
        bool _isExerciseVePaused,
        bool _isExercisePaused,
        uint256 _expiryCooldownTime
    ) ERC20(_name, _symbol, 18) {
        _grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, _admin);
        _grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, _admin);
        _setRoleAdmin(ADMIN_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
        _setRoleAdmin(MINTER_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
        _setRoleAdmin(PAUSER_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
        underlyingToken = _underlyingToken;
        voter = _voter;
        votingEscrow = IVoter(voter)._ve();
        router = _router;

        isExerciseLpPaused = _isExerciseLpPaused;
        isExerciseVePaused = _isExerciseVePaused;
        isExercisePaused = _isExercisePaused;

        treasurys.push(TreasuryConfig(_treasury,5,false));

        expiryCooldownTime = _expiryCooldownTime;

        emit AddTreasury(_treasury,5,false);
        emit SetRouter(_router);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure the minter is set you can set initially to the admin as done with PAUSER_ROLE

```javascript
_grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, _admin); // grant minter role to admin
```

IF the design is to allow mint to be called by both admin and minter just use || in the `onlyMinter` modifer so that the `msg.sender` with either role can still be able to mint.
