# If _to address doesn't implement onERC721Received try/catch won't go into the catch and will revert

## Summary
Issue High: If _to address doesn't implement onERC721Received try/catch won't go into the catch and will revert

## Vulnerability Detail

In the contract VotingEscrow.sol, the function `safeTransferFrom` will revert ,if `_to` do not implement onERC721Received, and catch block won't help

Converastion explaining why try/catch helps only if transaction is reverted in the target, the reason explained [there](https://forum.soliditylang.org/t/call-for-feedback-the-future-of-try-catch-in-solidity/1497)
 
[VotingEscrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/VotingEscrow.sol#L411-L426)
```solidity
    if (_isContract(_to)) {
            // Throws if transfer destination is a contract which does not implement 'onERC721Received'
            try IERC721Receiver(_to).onERC721Received(msg.sender, _from, _tokenId, _data) returns (bytes4 response) {
                if (response != IERC721Receiver(_to).onERC721Received.selector) {
                    revert("ERC721: ERC721Receiver rejected tokens");
                }
            } catch (bytes memory reason) {
                if (reason.length == 0) {
                    revert('ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer');
                } else {
                    assembly {
                        revert(add(32, reason), mload(reason))
                    }
                }
            }
        }
```
