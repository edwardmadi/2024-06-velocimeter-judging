# First liquidity provider of a stable pair can exploit the pool

## Summary
First liquidity provider of a stable pair can exploit the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
The invariant k of a stable pool is calculated as such: 

```javascript
function _k(uint x, uint y) internal view returns (uint) {
        if (stable) {
            uint _x = x * 1e18 / decimals0;
            uint _y = y * 1e18 / decimals1;
            uint _a = (_x * _y) / 1e18;
            uint _b = ((_x * _x) / 1e18 + (_y * _y) / 1e18);
            return _a * _b / 1e18;  // x3y+y3x >= k
        } else {
            return x * y; // xy >= k
        }
    }
```

When  `x*y < 1e18`, the value of `_a = (x * y ) / 1e18 = 0` due to rounding issues. When the invariant k of stable pools equals zero, the attacker can steal whatever is left in the pool. The first liquidity provider can exploit the the pair by performing the following: 

1. Mint a small amount of liquidity to the pool.
2. Withdraw or steal the remaining assets.
3. Repeat the process until the pool is drained or the total supply overflows.

## Impact
This could potentially disrupt the liquidity pool by either draining funds or causing instability in the pool operations.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding two restrictions on the first liquidity provider of stable pools:
1. Only allow equal amounts of liquidity.
2. Invariant k should be larger than a set minimum value (e.g. 10**10).
