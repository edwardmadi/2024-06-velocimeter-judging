# First Liquidity Provider can DOS the Pool in `Pair::mint()`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Pair` contract implements an Automated Market Maker (AMM system for both stable and volatile token pairs. It uses a constant product formula for volatile pairs (`x * y = k`) and a more complex formula for stable pairs (`x³y + y³x = k`). The contract allows users to add liquidity, remove liquidity, and perform swaps.

The [`mint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Pair.sol#L250-L269) function is responsible for adding liquidity to the pool. For the first liquidity provider, it calculates the initial liquidity tokens to be minted based on the square root of the product of the two token amounts provided. It also mints a small amount of liquidity tokens ([`MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Pair.sol#L31)) to `address(0)` to prevent the first liquidity provider from withdrawing all liquidity.

However, the contract fails to properly handle very small initial liquidity provisions for stable pairs. The [`_k()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/Pair.sol#L403-L413) function, which calculates the invariant k, can return zero due to rounding errors when dealing with very small amounts:

```solidity
function _k(uint x, uint y) internal view returns (uint) {
    if (stable) {
        uint _x = x * 1e18 / decimals0;
        uint _y = y * 1e18 / decimals1;
        uint _a = (_x * _y) / 1e18;
        uint _b = ((_x * _x) / 1e18 + (_y * _y) / 1e18);
        return _a * _b / 1e18;  // x3y+y3x >= k
    } else {
        return x * y; // xy >= k
    }
}
```

This vulnerability allows an attacker to repeatedly add small amounts of liquidity, drain the pool, and then repeat the process, effectively rendering the pool unusable and causing significant financial losses to other liquidity providers.

## Impact
An attacker can repeatedly drain the liquidity pool for stable pairs, causing a complete denial of service for the affected pair. This vulnerability undermines the core functionality of the AMM system, potentially leading to significant financial losses for other liquidity providers and rendering the affected stable pairs unusable.

## Proof of Concept
1. Attacker deploys the Pair contract and creates a stable pair.
2. Attacker adds a very small amount of initial liquidity (e.g., 10_000_000 wei of each token).
3. Attacker calls `mint()` to receive liquidity tokens.
4. Attacker performs swaps to drain the pool, exploiting the zero invariant issue.
5. Attacker repeats steps 2-4 multiple times, continuously draining the pool.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, implement additional checks in the `mint()` function for stable pairs:

```diff
function mint(address to) external lock returns (uint liquidity) {
    // ... existing code ...
    if (_totalSupply == 0) {
        liquidity = Math.sqrt(_amount0 * _amount1) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
        _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY);
+       if (stable) {
+           require(_amount0 * 1e18 / decimals0 == _amount1 * 1e18 / decimals1, "Pair: Stable pair must be equal amounts");
+           require(_k(_amount0, _amount1) > MINIMUM_K, "Pair: Stable pair must be above minimum k");
+       }
        // ... existing code ...
    }
    // ... existing code ...
}
```

Additionally, consider implementing a minimum liquidity requirement for stable pairs to prevent very small initial liquidity provisions. This could be done by setting a reasonable MINIMUM_K constant and checking against it in the `mint()` function.
