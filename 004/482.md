# The first liquidity provider can execute a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on a stable liquidity pool

## Summary

The first liquidity provider can execute a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on a stable liquidity pool. 

This is happen in `_k()` function when value of `_a = (x * y ) / 1e18 = 0` due to rounding error when `x*y < 1e18`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `Pair.sol` we have `_k()` function. The invariant *k* for stable pools is calculated using the formula:

```solidity
    function _k(uint x, uint y) internal view returns (uint) { 
        if (stable) {
            uint _x = x * 1e18 / decimals0;
            uint _y = y * 1e18 / decimals1;
            uint _a = (_x * _y) / 1e18;
            uint _b = ((_x * _x) / 1e18 + (_y * _y) / 1e18);
            return _a * _b / 1e18;  // x3y+y3x >= k
        } else {
            return x * y; // xy >= k
        }
    }
```

Let's pay attention on:

```solidity
uint _a = (_x * _y) / 1e18;
```

The value of `_a` can be zero when `x*y < 1e18`. The rounding error can lead to the invariant k of stable pools equals zero, and the trader can steal whatever is left in the pool.

This attack can be performed in the following way:

- The first LP can mint a small amount of liquidity to the pool.
- Due to rounding errors, *k* becomes zero.
- The attacker swaps tokens to drain the pool, exploiting the zero *k* invariant.

**Note**: This vulnerability is inspired by this issue from Spearbit: https://solodit.xyz/issues/first-liquidity-provider-of-a-stable-pair-can-dos-the-pool-spearbit-none-velodrome-finance-pdf
## Impact

The attacker can repeatedly mints small amounts of liquidity and uses swaps to drain the pool, leveraging the invariant *k* being zero due to rounding errors.
