# The First liquidity provider of a stable pair can DOS the pool

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The invariant _k of a _stable pool_ is calculated as shown below

```solidity
File: Pair.sol
403:     function _k(uint x, uint y) internal view returns (uint) { // @audit Sperabit Finding 5.2.6
404:         if (stable) {
405:             uint _x = x * 1e18 / decimals0;
406:             uint _y = y * 1e18 / decimals1;
407:             uint _a = (_x * _y) / 1e18;
408:             uint _b = ((_x * _x) / 1e18 + (_y * _y) / 1e18);
409:             return _a * _b / 1e18;  // x3y+y3x >= k
410:         } else {
411:             return x * y; // xy >= k
412:         }
413:     }

```
If `decimals0 == decimals1` and  `_x*_y < 1e18`, then `_a = (_x * _y) / 1e18` will round down to zero
This rounding error can lead to the invariant `_k` of `stable` pools to equals zero, and the trader can steal whatever is left in the pool.
This paves way for the first liquidity provider to DOS the pair by: 
- mint a small amount of liquidity to the pool such that `_k` = 0 (with `_k` = 0 and funds in the pool the pool becomes vulnerable)
- `_x` = `1_000_000_000` and `_y` = `1_000_000_000 - 1`
- Steal whatever is left in the pool by performing swaps
- Repeat step 1, and step 2 until the overflow of the total supply


```solidity
    function mint(address to) external lock returns (uint liquidity) {
        ...

        uint _totalSupply = totalSupply; // gas savings, must be defined here since totalSupply can update in _mintFee
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            liquidity = Math.sqrt(_amount0 * _amount1) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
            _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); // permanently lock the first MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY tokens
        } else {
            liquidity = Math.min(_amount0 * _totalSupply / _reserve0, _amount1 * _totalSupply / _reserve1);
        }
  @>    require(liquidity > 0, 'ILM'); // Pair: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY_MINTED
        _mint(to, liquidity);

        ...
    }
```
To prevent this rounding error, the reserve of a pool should never be allowed to go too small. The `mint(...)` function which was
borrowed from `UniswapV2` has a minimum liquidity check of `sqrt(a * b) > MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY`.  This, however,
isn't safe enough to protect the invariant formula of stable pools.

For transparency, this finding was raised in the [spearbit velodrome](https://solodit.xyz/issues/dos-attack-by-delegating-tokens-at-max_delegates-1024-spearbit-none-velodrome-finance-pdf) audit issue 5.2.6. I am reporting it here because the vulnerability still exists with the same impact.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- only allows equal amounts of liquidity.
- `_k` should be check to always be larger than `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY`
