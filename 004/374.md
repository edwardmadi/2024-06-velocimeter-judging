# First liquidity provider of a stable pair can DOS the pool

## Summary
DOS Of a Pool due to breaking of a invariant

## Vulnerability Detail
The value of _a = (x * y ) / 1e18 = 0 due to rounding error when x*y < 1e18. The rounding error can lead to
the invariant k of stable pools equals zero, and the trader can steal whatever is left in the pool.
The first liquidity provider can DOS the pair by: 1.mint a small amount of liquidity to the pool, 2. Steal whatever is
left in the pool, 3. Repeat step 1, and step 2 until the overflow of the total supply.
To prevent the issue of rounding error, the reserve of a pool should never go too small. The mint function which was
borrowed from uniswapV2 has a minimum liquidity check of sqrt(a * b) > MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY; This, however,
isn't safe enough to protect the invariant formula of stable pools.
```solidity
uint internal constant MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY = 10**3;
/.....
....
.....
...,..../
function _k(uint x, uint y) internal view returns (uint) {
        if (stable) {
            uint _x = x * 1e18 / decimals0;
            uint _y = y * 1e18 / decimals1;
            uint _a = (_x * _y) / 1e18;
            uint _b = ((_x * _x) / 1e18 + (_y * _y) / 1e18);
            return _a * _b / 1e18;  // x3y+y3x >= k
        } else {
            return x * y; // xy >= k
        }
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
 invariant _k should be larger than the MINIMUM_K
