# First LP provider of stable pair can DOS the pool

## Summary

The Pair contract is a fork of velodrome's pair contract, with some changes. However an issue discovered by the spearbit team with the invariant `_k` calculation which can allow the first LP provider of a stable pair to DOS the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

In a process involving continuously minting small liquidity amounts and stealing what is left in the pool by any vailable method, e.g conducting multiple swaps with a specialized contract, a malicious first lp provider can cause the pool's totalsupply to overflow.

```solidity
    function mint(address to) external lock returns (uint liquidity) {
        (uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) = (reserve0, reserve1);
        uint _balance0 = IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint _balance1 = IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint _amount0 = _balance0 - _reserve0;
        uint _amount1 = _balance1 - _reserve1;

        uint _totalSupply = totalSupply; // gas savings, must be defined here since totalSupply can update in _mintFee
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            liquidity = Math.sqrt(_amount0 * _amount1) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
            _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); // permanently lock the first MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY tokens
        } else {
            liquidity = Math.min(_amount0 * _totalSupply / _reserve0, _amount1 * _totalSupply / _reserve1);
        }
        require(liquidity > 0, 'ILM'); // Pair: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY_MINTED
        _mint(to, liquidity);

        _update(_balance0, _balance1, _reserve0, _reserve1);
        emit Mint(msg.sender, _amount0, _amount1);
    }
```
This is because of the calculation of the `_k` invariant for the stable pool can be made 0. With small values of `_x` and `_y`, the value of `_a` can be 0, due to `_x` * `_y` being less than 1e18. As a result, the value of `_k` will be 0, opening up the contract to this attack vector. More about the issue, including a runnable POC, which also applies to the protocol's own Pair.sol can be read [here](https://solodit.xyz/issues/first-liquidity-provider-of-a-stable-pair-can-dos-the-pool-spearbit-none-velodrome-finance-pdf). 

```solidity

    function _k(uint x, uint y) internal view returns (uint) {
        if (stable) {
            uint _x = x * 1e18 / decimals0;
            uint _y = y * 1e18 / decimals1;
            uint _a = (_x * _y) / 1e18;
            uint _b = ((_x * _x) / 1e18 + (_y * _y) / 1e18);
            return _a * _b / 1e18;  // x3y+y3x >= k
        } else {
            return x * y; // xy >= k
        }
    }
```
## Impact

Malicious lp provider can drain and dos the stable pair pool

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation
A minimum parameter for the value of `_k` should be introduced, to ensure that the returned value is not 0.
