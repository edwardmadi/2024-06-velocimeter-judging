# First liquidity provider of a stable pair can DOS the pool

## Summary

The invariant k of a stable pool can be broken with rounding error.

## Vulnerability Detail

The value of `_a = (x * y) / 1e18` can become zero due to rounding errors when  x*y <1e18. This rounding error can result in the invariant k of stable pools becoming zero, allowing a trader to steal whatever is left in the pool. The first liquidity provider can exploit this by:
1. Minting a small amount of liquidity to the pool.
2. Stealing whatever is left in the pool.
3. Repeating steps 1 and 2 until the total supply overflows.
To prevent rounding errors, the reserve of a pool should never be too small. The mint function, borrowed from UniswapV2, has a minimum liquidity check,  however, this isn't sufficient to protect the invariant formula of stable pools.

```solidity
function _k(uint x, uint y) internal view returns (uint) {a
        if (stable) {
            uint _x = x * 1e18 / decimals0;
            uint _y = y * 1e18 / decimals1;
            uint _a = (_x * _y) / 1e18;
            uint _b = ((_x * _x) / 1e18 + (_y * _y) / 1e18);
            return _a * _b / 1e18;  // x3y+y3x >= k
        }

```

## Impact

First liq providers  can drain the pool's liquidity
