# Gauge's rewardRate can be reduced by adding additional tokens to an existing reward distribution

## Summary
The reward rate for a given asset is reduced if `Gauge.notifyRewardAmount()` is called while the gauge is already distributing the token.

## Vulnerability Detail
The reward rate for a gauge is adjusted through `notifyRewardAmount()`. If the gauge is already distributing a given reward token and `notifyReawrdAmount()` is called again, it will add the additional amount on top of the remaining funds and adjust the reward rate accordingly. But, because of a bug in the calculation, the remaining funds' distribution will be reset to the original duration (5 days). That will cause the reward rate to decrease.

Given that the gauge distributes 1000 USDC over 5 days, the reward rate would be $1000 / 5 = 200$ USDC per day. After some time has passed, e.g.  4 days, `notifyRewardAmount()` is called again to add 201 USDC, then the new reward rate is: $401 / 5 = 80.2$ USDC per day.

```sol
            uint _remaining = periodFinish[token] - block.timestamp;
            uint _left = _remaining * rewardRate[token];
            require(amount > _left); 
            uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
            rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / DURATION;
```

## Impact
Reduced yield for gauge depositors.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of checking whether `amount > _left`, verify that the new reward rate is larger.
