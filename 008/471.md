# Re-Entrancy Vulnerability in notifyRewardAmount Function

## Summary
The notifyRewardAmount function in the GaugeV4 contract has a critical vulnerability related to the handling of reward notifications. This vulnerability can lead to incorrect or malicious reward distributions, potentially causing significant financial loss and impacting the integrity of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Detailed Explanation
The notifyRewardAmount function updates the reward amount for a specific token. However, the implementation lacks thorough validation and has potential issues with re-entrancy protection. These issues include improper validation of the reward amount and inconsistent state updates, which could be exploited by an attacker.

Key Issues
Re-Entrancy Attack Surface:

The _safeTransferFrom function can potentially call back into the contract, depending on the implementation of the token contract, leading to a re-entrancy attack.
Insufficient Validation of amount:

There is no thorough validation of the amount parameter beyond ensuring it is greater than zero. This can lead to scenarios where incorrect reward amounts are notified.
Inconsistent State Updates:

The function updates state variables (rewardRate, periodFinish, etc.) in multiple places without ensuring atomicity. This can lead to inconsistent states if the function is called multiple times in quick succession.

`function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
    require(token != stake);
    require(amount > 0);
    if (!isReward[token]) {
        require(IVoter(voter).isWhitelisted(token), "rewards tokens must be whitelisted");
        require(rewards.length < MAX_REWARD_TOKENS, "too many rewards tokens");
    }
    if (rewardRate[token] == 0) _writeRewardPerTokenCheckpoint(token, 0, block.timestamp);
    (rewardPerTokenStored[token], lastUpdateTime[token]) = _updateRewardPerToken(token, type(uint).max, true);

    if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish[token]) {
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        rewardRate[token] = amount / DURATION;
    } else {
        uint _remaining = periodFinish[token] - block.timestamp;
        uint _left = _remaining * rewardRate[token];
        require(amount > _left);
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / DURATION;
    }
    require(rewardRate[token] > 0);
    uint balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(rewardRate[token] <= balance / DURATION, "Provided reward too high");
    periodFinish[token] = block.timestamp + DURATION;
    if (!isReward[token]) {
        isReward[token] = true;
        rewards.push(token);
    }

    emit NotifyReward(msg.sender, token, amount);
}
`
## Impact
Re-Entrancy Attack: If a malicious token contract is used, it can call back into the notifyRewardAmount function and manipulate the state, potentially draining rewards or causing inconsistent states.
Incorrect Reward Distribution: Lack of thorough validation can lead to incorrect reward amounts being set, causing either under or over-distribution of rewards, impacting all stakeholders.
Inconsistent State: Multiple calls to the function in quick succession can lead to inconsistent states due to non-atomic updates, causing unexpected behavior in reward calculations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Re-Entrancy Guard:

Ensure that the _safeTransferFrom function is protected against re-entrancy by using the checks-effects-interactions pattern properly.
Thorough Validation of amount:

Validate the amount parameter more thoroughly to ensure it aligns with expected reward distributions and does not lead to misconfigurations.
