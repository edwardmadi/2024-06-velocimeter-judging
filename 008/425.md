# Users that don't checkpoint frequently at the GaugeV4 contract may lose rewards

## Summary
If a user doesn't claim its rewards after the periodFinish timestamp of a token is passed, malicious parties can upgrade the rewardRate to 1 wei and make the previously unclaimed rewards lost.
## Vulnerability Detail
According to the following code snippet, if the block.timestamp is bigger or equal to the period finish for a token, then the rewardRate for that token is based on the amount that is currently being notified at the notifyRewardAmount call:
```solidty
function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
    ...
if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish[token]) {
            uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;

            rewardRate[token] = amount / DURATION;
        }
...
}
```

This means the rewardRate can be updated to 1 wei for a token and all the calls that rely on it result in extremely low values.

The earned function calculates a part of the rewards by iterating over a user's checkpoints:
```solidity
    function earned(address token, address account) public view returns (uint) {
        ...
        if (_endIndex > 0) {
            for (uint i = _startIndex; i <= _endIndex-1; i++) {
                Checkpoint memory cp0 = checkpoints[account][i];
                Checkpoint memory cp1 = checkpoints[account][i+1];
                (uint _rewardPerTokenStored0,) = getPriorRewardPerToken(token, cp0.timestamp);
                // @audit b-me-24 -> this is the same if i = endIndex -1
                (uint _rewardPerTokenStored1,) = getPriorRewardPerToken(token, cp1.timestamp);
                reward += cp0.balanceOf * (_rewardPerTokenStored1 - _rewardPerTokenStored0) / PRECISION;
            }
        }
        ...
}
```

The next step would be to accrue the rewards for the period which no checkpoint has accounted for. This happens at the following code snippet:
```solidity
		Checkpoint memory cp = checkpoints[account][_endIndex];
        (uint _rewardPerTokenStored,) = getPriorRewardPerToken(token, cp.timestamp);
        reward += cp.balanceOf * (rewardPerToken(token) - Math.max(_rewardPerTokenStored, userRewardPerTokenStored[token][account])) / PRECISION;

```

This calculation relies on the rewardPerToken function. Lets take a look at its implementation:
```solidity
function rewardPerToken(address token) public view returns (uint) {
        if (derivedSupply == 0) {
            return rewardPerTokenStored[token];
        }

        return rewardPerTokenStored[token] + ((lastTimeRewardApplicable(token) - Math.min(lastUpdateTime[token], periodFinish[token])) * rewardRate[token] * PRECISION / derivedSupply);
    }
```

Notice how it relies on the rewardRate mapping value for the token to calculate the amount of rewards to distribute to the user.
The issue with that lies on the checkpoints. If a user doesn't call checkpoints for certain periods, then he/she may earn much less rewards than what should be distributed.
## Impact
Users may lose their earned rewards in the event they don't claim it frequently enough.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure to checkpoint rewards per token as well. The current implementation allows users that have deposited identical balances to claim at different periods and earn rewards based on entirely different curves. By introducing rewardPerToken checkpoints, each timestamp can be associated with certain earnings and all users will earn at the same rate.
