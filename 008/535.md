# Gauge's rewardRate will be griefed when new rewards are added

## Summary
Invoking `notifyRewardAmount` mid-distribution will decrease rewardRate substantially 
## Vulnerability Detail
Once rewards are added to a gauge, the amount is divided by 604800 (seconds in a week) in order to calculate the reward per second. Whenever new rewards are added to the gauge, the reward rate is recalculated and stored [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/GaugeV4.sol#L587). The problem lies within the fact that it divides the new token amount by the entire duration again.   

For the sake of simplicity let's assume that DURATION = 10 periods and initial rewards are 1000 tokens. 
rewardRate = 1000 / 10 = 100 tokens per period
Some time passes and there are 200 tokens and 2 periods left
`notifyrewardAmount` is invoked with amount = 201 tokens 
rewardRate = (201 + 200) / 10 = 40.1 tokens per period 

`notifyRewardAmount` being permisionless allows malicious actors to grief the protocol and its' users by reducing rate at which rewards are paid out.
## Impact
Users receive less rewards than expected over a given period
## Code Snippet
```solidity
     function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
        require(token != stake);
        require(amount > 0);
        ***SNIP***
        } else {
            uint _remaining = periodFinish[token] - block.timestamp;
            uint _left = _remaining * rewardRate[token];
            require(amount > _left); 
            uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
            rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / DURATION; // @audit dividing by entire duration, mid-duration griefs rate
        }           
```

## Recommendation
Impose access control on `notifyRewardAmount`
