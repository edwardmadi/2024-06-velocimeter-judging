# Incorrect Calculation of the New rewardRate[token] Can Result in Some Late Users Not Receiving Their Rewards.

## Summary

The reward per token can be much higher than expected, which makes the total amount of reward tokens less than the total amount of rewards accumulated by all the users.

## Vulnerability Detail

In GaugeV4.sol, `notifyRewardAmount()`, the updated rewardRate for the token is calculated based on the newly added amount of tokens (amount), the remaining amount of existing rewards (_left), and the `DURATION`.

```Solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
...
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish[token]) {
            uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
            rewardRate[token] = amount / DURATION;
        } else {
            uint _remaining = periodFinish[token] - block.timestamp;
            uint _left = _remaining * rewardRate[token];
            require(amount > _left); 
            uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
            rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / DURATION;
        }
...
```

Although the `DURATION` is set to 7 days, the actual period from the current time to periodFinish[token] is much longer.
The `rewardPerToken()` calculation depends on the current time, lastUpdateTime[token], and rewardRate[token].

The lastUpdateTime[token] is frequently updated to the current timestamp by `_updateRewardForAllTokens()`.

As a result, `rewardPerToken` can be much higher than expected, leading to the total amount of reward tokens being less than the total rewards accumulated by all users.

This discrepancy causes users who claim rewards later to be unable to retrieve their full rewards due to insufficient balance.

## Proof of Concept

1. Alice and Bob deposited: 1653091200 -> July 12, 2024, 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Unix timestamp: 1720838400)
2. Admin called notifyRewardAmount: 1653100000 -> July 12, 2024, 02:26:40 GMT+0000 (Unix timestamp: 1720847200)
3. start time: 1653004800 -> July 11, 2024, 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Unix timestamp: 1720752000)
4. start time + DURATION: 1653609600 -> July 19, 2024, 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Unix timestamp: 1721356800)
5. periodFinish[FLOW]: 1654041600 -> July 24, 2024, 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Unix timestamp: 1721788800)
6. lastUpdateTime[FLOW]: 1653100000 -> July 12, 2024, 02:26:40 GMT+0000 (Unix timestamp: 1720847200)
7. Alice withdrawn and getReward: 1654041800 -> July 24, 2024, 00:03:20 GMT+0000 (Unix timestamp: 1721789000)
8. Bob can't withdraw and transaction reverts

```Solidity
    function testRewardDistribution() public {
        // Simulate deposits by Alice and Bob
        deal(address(flowDaiPair), address(owner), 1000 ether);
        deal(address(flowDaiPair), address(owner2), 1000 ether);
        vm.warp(1720838400); // July 12, 2024, 00:00:00 GMT+0000
        vm.startPrank(address(owner));
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(this), type(uint256).max);
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(gauge), type(uint256).max);
        gauge.depositFor(address(owner), 1000 * 1e18);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(address(owner2));
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(this), type(uint256).max);
        flowDaiPair.approve(address(gauge), type(uint256).max);
        gauge.depositFor(address(owner2), 1000 * 1e18);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Admin notifies reward amount
        vm.warp(1720847200); // July 12, 2024, 02:26:40 GMT+0000
        address admin = vm.addr(1000);
        deal(address(FLOW), address(admin), 10000 ether);
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        FLOW.approve(address(this), type(uint256).max);
        FLOW.approve(address(gauge), type(uint256).max);
        gauge.notifyRewardAmount(address(FLOW), 1000 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Check reward distribution
        vm.warp(1721789000); // July 24, 2024, 00:03:20 GMT+0000
        vm.startPrank(address(owner));
        gauge.withdraw(1000 * 1e18);
        // gauge.getReward(owners[0],);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Alice should get 1,000 DAI
        uint256 aliceReward = flowDaiPair.balanceOf(address(owner));
        assertEq(aliceReward, 1000 * 1e18);

        // Bob tries to get reward and the transaction should revert
        vm.startPrank(address(owner2));
        vm.expectRevert(); // Expect revert due to insufficient balance
        address[] memory _tokens = new address[](1);
        _tokens[0] = address(FLOW);
        gauge.getReward(address(owner2), _tokens);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Impact

This issue leads the users who claim the rewards later unable to retrieve their rewards as the balance can be insufficient.

## Recommendation

Consider calculating rewardRate base on timeUntilNextPeriodFinish to next period finish:

```diff
    function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
...
+       uint timeUntilNextPeriodFinish = DURATION - block.timestamp;
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish[token]) {
            uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
-           rewardRate[token] = amount / DURATION;
+           rewardRate[token] = amount / timeUntilNextPeriodFinish;
        } else {
            uint _remaining = periodFinish[token] - block.timestamp;
            uint _left = _remaining * rewardRate[token];
            require(amount > _left); 
            uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
-           rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / DURATION;
+           rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / timeUntilNextPeriodFinish;
        }
        require(rewardRate[token] > 0);
        uint balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
-       require(rewardRate[token] <= balance / DURATION, "Provided reward too high");
+       require(rewardRate[token] <= balance / timeUntilNextPeriodFinish, "Provided reward too high");
```
