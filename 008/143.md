# Any user can extend reward periods indefinitely, diluting rewards for stakers (`GaugeV4::notifyRewardAmount`)

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `GaugeV4` contract implements a staking and reward distribution system where users can stake tokens and earn rewards over time. The [`notifyRewardAmount()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/GaugeV4.sol#L563-L599) is designed to allow the addition of new rewards or the extension of existing reward periods. However, this function lacks proper access control, creating a vulnerability that can be exploited to manipulate the reward distribution mechanism.

The `notifyRewardAmount()` function performs the following key operations:
1. Validates that the reward token is not the stake token and that the amount is greater than zero.
2. Updates the reward per token stored and the last update time.
3. Calculates the new reward rate based on whether the current period has finished or not.
4. Extends the reward period by setting `periodFinish[token] = block.timestamp + DURATION`.

The critical issue lies in the fact that this function is `external` and can be called by any address. There are no restrictions on who can extend an active reward period or how frequently it can be extended. This allows malicious actors to repeatedly call the function with minimal amounts of reward tokens, effectively diluting the rewards for all stakers.

The vulnerability is particularly severe because:
1. It can be exploited with minimal cost, especially on L2s with low gas fees.
2. It allows for continuous extension of the reward period, potentially indefinitely.
3. It directly impacts the yield of legitimate stakers, as the reward rate is diluted over a longer period.

The highest impact scenario involves an attacker repeatedly calling `notifyRewardAmount()` with small amounts of reward tokens, extending the reward period indefinitely and significantly reducing the effective reward rate for all stakers.

## Impact
The ability for any user to extend reward periods indefinitely leads to a severe dilution of rewards for legitimate stakers. This undermines the entire reward distribution mechanism of the protocol, potentially causing a significant loss of yield for users. The attack can be sustained for long periods with minimal cost to the attacker, especially on networks with low transaction fees. 

## Proof of Concept
1. Attacker observes the current `periodFinish[token]` for a specific reward token.
2. Just before `periodFinish[token]`, the attacker calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with a small amount of reward tokens (e.g., 1 wei).
3. This extends the reward period by `DURATION` (7 days), significantly diluting the reward rate.
4. The attacker repeats step 2 every 7 days, continuously extending the reward period.
5. Legitimate stakers find their rewards are much lower than expected due to the continuously diluted reward rate.

Relevant code:

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
    // ... (input validation)
    if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish[token]) {
        // ... (calculate new reward rate)
    } else {
        // ... (extend existing reward period)
    }
    // ... (update reward rate and period)
    periodFinish[token] = block.timestamp + DURATION;
    // ...
}
```

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, implement proper access control on the `notifyRewardAmount()` function. Only allow a designated reward distributor or contract owner to extend active reward periods. Additionally, consider implementing a minimum reward amount threshold to prevent trivial extensions.

Here's a suggested fix:

```diff
+ address public rewardDistributor;

function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {
    require(token != stake);
    require(amount > 0);
+   require(msg.sender == rewardDistributor, "Only reward distributor can notify rewards");
+   require(amount >= MINIMUM_REWARD_AMOUNT, "Reward amount too low");
    // ... (rest of the function remains the same)
}

+ function setRewardDistributor(address _rewardDistributor) external {
+     require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set reward distributor");
+     rewardDistributor = _rewardDistributor;
+ }
```

This change ensures that only a designated reward distributor can extend reward periods and adds a minimum threshold for reward amounts, preventing trivial extensions and protecting the interests of legitimate stakers.
