# Attacker can delay gauge reward distribution indefinitely

## Summary
Attacker can delay gauge reward distribution indefinitely 

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, within `GaugeV4` any user can call `notifyRewardAmount` and contribute rewards to the gauge. In case the current reward period has not finished, it takes the remaining rewards, adds them to the new rewards and redistributes them for a week.

```solidity
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish[token]) {
            uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
            rewardRate[token] = amount / DURATION;
        } else {
            uint _remaining = periodFinish[token] - block.timestamp;
            uint _left = _remaining * rewardRate[token];
            require(amount > _left); 
            uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
            amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
            rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / DURATION;
        }
```

The problem is that this allows any user to call this function with 0/ dust amount and always re-distribute the funds for the next week.

If a user calls this function once every hour, only 64% of the funds will be distributed within the expected week and the rest will be delayed into the future (where they can keep getting more and more delayed).

Attack scales depending on how often the function is called.

## Impact
Rewards will be delayed instead of distributed.

## Recommendation
make the function restricted, or add a min amount that the user has to deposit
