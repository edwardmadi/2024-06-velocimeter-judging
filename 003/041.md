# The user's funds will be permanently locked and unclaimable

## Summary

Users can deposit funds on behalf of others, causing their funds to be permanently locked.

## Vulnerability Detail

In GaugeV4, users can deposit with a lock period through `depositWithLock`, making the amount locked in the contract for a certain period, unable to be withdrawn. However, users can also use `OptionTokenV4._exerciseLp` to call `depositWithLock` on behalf of others, which will reset the `LockEnd[account]` time.

Therefore, if User A calls `depositWithLock` to make a deposit, a malicious user can call `OptionTokenV4._exerciseLp` to deposit the minimum amount on behalf of User A, resetting User A's lock period. The malicious user can reset the `LockEnd` time just before the locked amount's period ends, effectively causing User A's funds to be permanently locked.

Additionally, the admin can create a new gauge to allow users to withdraw their funds after the latest lock period. However, the rewards in the gauge are time-sensitive. If the admin creates a new gauge, it can prevent `OptionTokenV4` from sending funds to the old gauge. However, because the user's funds are locked and cannot be transferred to the new gauge, and the gauge is no longer the old gauge, the user will not be able to claim the rewards in the new gauge.
