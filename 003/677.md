# logic bug in calculation and handling of the `paymentAmount` and `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity`.


## Vulnerability Detail


in the `_exerciseVe` function. The issue is related to the calculation and handling of the `paymentAmount` and `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity`.

in this part : 


```solidity
(uint256 paymentAmount, uint256 paymentAmountToAddLiquidity) = getPaymentTokenAmountForExerciseLp(_amount, _discount);
if (paymentAmount > _maxPaymentAmount)
    revert OptionToken_SlippageTooHigh();

// Take team fee
uint256 paymentGaugeRewardAmount = _discount == 0 ? 0 : _takeFees(
    paymentToken,
    paymentAmount
);
_safeTransferFrom(
    paymentToken,
    msg.sender,
    address(this),
    paymentGaugeRewardAmount + paymentAmountToAddLiquidity
);
```

The issue is that the function is calculating two separate amounts (`paymentAmount` and `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity`), but it's only checking the `paymentAmount` against the `_maxPaymentAmount`. However, it's requesting the user to transfer `paymentGaugeRewardAmount + paymentAmountToAddLiquidity`, which could potentially be higher than `_maxPaymentAmount`.

This could lead to a situation where the transaction reverts due to insufficient allowance or balance, even though the slippage check passed.

To fix this, we should:

1. Calculate the total amount the user needs to pay.
2. Check this total amount against `_maxPaymentAmount`.
3. Use the total amount for the fee calculation and transfer.



## Impact

The maximum impact of this bug could be significant:

1. Financial Loss: Users could end up paying more than they expected or agreed to. In the worst-case scenario, they might pay up to twice the amount they anticipated (the sum of paymentAmount and paymentAmountToAddLiquidity), which could be a substantial financial loss.

2. Transaction Failures: If users set their _maxPaymentAmount based on the expected paymentAmount alone, many transactions could fail unexpectedly when the contract tries to transfer more tokens than approved or available.
