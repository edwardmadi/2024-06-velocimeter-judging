# User might lose funds when adding liquidity within `OptionTokenV4`

## Summary
User might lose funds when adding liquidity within `OptionTokenV4`

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user wishes to exercise their option tokens into LP within `OptionTokenV4`, the contract calculates the necessary amounts to add as liquidity by checking the current pool reserves. 

```solidity
    function getPaymentTokenAmountForExerciseLp(uint256 _amount,uint256 _discount) public view returns (uint256 paymentAmount, uint256 paymentAmountToAddLiquidity)
    {
       
        paymentAmount = _discount == 0 ? 0 : getLpDiscountedPrice(_amount, _discount);
        (uint256 underlyingReserve, uint256 paymentReserve) = IRouter(router).getReserves(underlyingToken, paymentToken, false);
        paymentAmountToAddLiquidity = (_amount * paymentReserve) / underlyingReserve;
    }
```

The problem is that it never checks that the price is not manipulated. This allows for adding liquidity at a manipulated price, which would later result in the user losing most of their funds. An attacker could utilize this and sandwich users for profit. 

Imagine following scenario: 
1. Attacker sees user's transactions and front-runs swapping a large amount of FLOW, making it's relative price drop.
2. User's transaction executes. They add liquidity with FLOW being worth dust amounts of payment token.
3. Attacker back-runs and arbs the pool back to normal prices. Due to the added liquidity by the victim, attacker makes a profit.
