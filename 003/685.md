# Potential Loss of Locked Funds on Re-deposit in `depositWithLock`


## Summary
A user calling `depositWithLock` will experiance fund loss if they have an existing balance from previous lock.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `depositWithLock` 

```solidity
function depositWithLock(address account, uint256 amount, uint256 _lockDuration) external lock {
        require(msg.sender == account || isOToken[msg.sender],"Not allowed to deposit with lock"); 
        _deposit(account, amount, 0);

        if(block.timestamp >= lockEnd[account]) { 
            delete lockEnd[account];
            delete balanceWithLock[account];
        }

        balanceWithLock[account] += amount;
        uint256 currentLockEnd = lockEnd[account];
        uint256 newLockEnd = block.timestamp + _lockDuration ;
        if (currentLockEnd > newLockEnd) {
            revert("The current lock end > new lock end");
        } 
        lockEnd[account] = newLockEnd;
    }

```
The depositWithLock function allows users to deposit tokens with a lock duration. However, if the current lock has expired and the user attempts to deposit with lock again before withdrawing the previously locked balance, the previous locked balance is deleted. This leads to a loss of the previous locked balance, causing unexpected fund loss for the user.

```solidity
 function withdrawToken(uint amount, uint tokenId) public lock {
        _updateRewardForAllTokens();

        uint256 totalBalance = balanceOf[msg.sender];
        uint256 lockedAmount = balanceWithLock[msg.sender];
        uint256 freeAmount = totalBalance - lockedAmount;
        // Update lock related mappings when withdraw amount greater than free amount
        if (amount > freeAmount) {
            // Check if lock has expired
            require(block.timestamp >= lockEnd[msg.sender], "The lock didn't expire");
            uint256 newLockedAmount = totalBalance - amount;
            if (newLockedAmount == 0) {
                delete lockEnd[msg.sender];
                delete balanceWithLock[msg.sender];
            } else {
                balanceWithLock[msg.sender] = newLockedAmount;
            }
        }

        totalSupply -= amount;
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        _safeTransfer(stake, msg.sender, amount);

        if (tokenId > 0) {
            require(tokenId == tokenIds[msg.sender]);
            tokenIds[msg.sender] = 0;
            IVoter(voter).detachTokenFromGauge(tokenId, msg.sender);
        } else {
            tokenId = tokenIds[msg.sender];
        }

        uint _derivedBalance = derivedBalances[msg.sender];
        derivedSupply -= _derivedBalance;
        _derivedBalance = derivedBalance(msg.sender);
        derivedBalances[msg.sender] = _derivedBalance;
        derivedSupply += _derivedBalance;

        _writeCheckpoint(msg.sender, derivedBalances[msg.sender]);
        _writeSupplyCheckpoint();

        IVoter(voter).emitWithdraw(tokenId, msg.sender, amount);
        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, tokenId, amount);
    }

```
Additionally, the `withdrawToken` function allows the withdrawal of a user-specified amount, potentially leaving a remainder balance in the previous lock, which contributes to the issue.

## Impact
Users may lose their previously locked tokens if they make a new deposit with lock after the lock duration has expired but before withdrawing their previously locked tokens. This could lead to a significant loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Allow the balance to accumulate instead of resetting it.
- Add an external function call within withdrawToken to withdraw any remaining locked amount back to the user.
