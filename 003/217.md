# User should be able to set max `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity` they're willing to pay

## Summary
User should be able to set max `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity` they're willing to pay

## Vulnerability Detail
When user wants to exercise their option token into `ve`/`lp`, they're only only able to specify the max `paymentAmount` they're willing to pay for the `FLOW` token, but not the amount of `paymentToken` that they'll have to pay for the `LP`

```solidity
        (uint256 paymentAmount,uint256 paymentAmountToAddLiquidity) =  getPaymentTokenAmountForExerciseLp(_amount,_discount); // TODO decide if we want to have the curve or just always maxlock
        if (paymentAmount > _maxPaymentAmount)
            revert OptionToken_SlippageTooHigh();
```

This leads to a tricky situation where the user might be forced to add more `paymentToken` than what they'd usually expect. Note that this is different from the other issue, as even in the case where contract checks that pool's reserves are within deviation, user might still not want to add liquidity at current prices. This could especially be caused by 1) protocol being okay with higher deviation that what the user would want or 2) user's transaction being stuck for too long, allowing for high price movements, which would still be deemed within reasonable deviation.

## Impact
User forced to add liquidity at undesirable prices
