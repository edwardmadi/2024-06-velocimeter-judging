# `OptionTokenV4::getPaymentTokenAmountForExerciseLp` uses the spot price of the `Pair`, which is easily manipulatable

## Summary

`OptionTokenV4::getPaymentTokenAmountForExerciseLp` uses the spot price of the `Pair` to calculate the amount of liquidity to add, which is easily manipulatable.

A malicious user can manipulate the reserves for their benefit, potentially paying less for the amount of LP minted.

## Vulnerability Detail

`OptionTokenV4::exerciseVe` and `OptionTokenV4::exerciseLp` burn `oFLOW` from the caller and pulls `payment token` to add `FLOW` and `payment token` to the respective pair for LP tokens.

The amount of `payment token` to pull is calculated via the following:

[OptionTokenV4.sol#L607](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L607)
```javascript
(uint256 paymentAmount,uint256 paymentAmountToAddLiquidity) =  getPaymentTokenAmountForExerciseLp(_amount,_discount); 
```

[OptionTokenV4.sol#L350-L356](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L350-L356)
```javascript
    function getPaymentTokenAmountForExerciseLp(uint256 _amount,uint256 _discount) public view returns (uint256 paymentAmount, uint256 paymentAmountToAddLiquidity)
    {
       
        paymentAmount = _discount == 0 ? 0 : getLpDiscountedPrice(_amount, _discount);
@>      (uint256 underlyingReserve, uint256 paymentReserve) = IRouter(router).getReserves(underlyingToken, paymentToken, false);
        paymentAmountToAddLiquidity = (_amount * paymentReserve) / underlyingReserve;
    }
```

`IRouter::getReserves` returns the current reserves (spot price) of the underlying/payment pair. This can lead to price manipulation where a malicious user can manipulate the pair reserves for their benefit.

## Impact

Price manipulation (i.e, via flash loan), users may be able to pay less for LP minted.
