# ExerciseLP allows anyone to increase the lock of other users

## Summary
A malicious party can call exerciseLp at the OptionTokenV4 to increase someone else's lock at the GaugeV4 contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The exerciseLp function at the OptionTOkenV4 contract allows anyone to call it with whatever `_recipient` address as desired:
```solidity
function exerciseLp(
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _maxPaymentAmount,
        address _recipient,
        uint256 _discount,
        uint256 _deadline
    ) external returns (uint256, uint256) {
        if (block.timestamp > _deadline) revert OptionToken_PastDeadline();
        return _exerciseLp(_amount, _maxPaymentAmount, _recipient, _discount);
    }

```

The issue with that is a malicious caller is able to set arbitrary lock periods for users that have not opted into it.
By picking the biggest discount possible, the `_exerciseLp` function will call the GaugeV4's depositWithLock function:
```solidity
function _exerciseLp(
        uint256 _amount,   // the oTOKEN amount the user wants to redeem with
        uint256 _maxPaymentAmount, // the 
        address _recipient,
        uint256 _discount
    ) internal returns (uint256 paymentAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
    ...
IGaugeV4(_gauge).depositWithLock(
            _recipient,
            lpAmount,
            getLockDurationForLpDiscount(_discount)
        );
        ...  
}       
        
        
function getLockDurationForLpDiscount(
        uint256 _discount
    ) public view returns (uint256 duration) {
        (int256 slope, int256 intercept) = getSlopeInterceptForLpDiscount();
        duration = _discount == 0 ? lockDurationForMaxLpDiscount : SignedMath.abs(slope * int256(_discount) + intercept);
    }
```

As the depositWithLock function will accept any call sent by the OToken, the GaugeV4 contract will not revert the lock extension and update the lock with the new lockDuration:
```solidty
function depositWithLock(address account, uint256 amount, uint256 _lockDuration) external lock {
        require(msg.sender == account || isOToken[msg.sender],"Not allowed to deposit with lock"); 
        ...
        
        uint256 currentLockEnd = lockEnd[account];
        uint256 newLockEnd = block.timestamp + _lockDuration ;
        ...
        lockEnd[account] = newLockEnd;
    }
```
## Impact
Users may have their lock extended without their consent.
Malicious parties can lock the funds of all users into the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure to implement access control on the exerciseLp function so only the recipient can call this function for itself. Otherwise malicious parties are able to increase other user's lock duration.
