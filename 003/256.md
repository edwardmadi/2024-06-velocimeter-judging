# Improperly hardcoded slippage parameters will lead to sandwich attacks

## Summary

Excercising options for LPs and VE tokens interact with router to add liquidity without using the proper slippage parameters.

## Vulnerability Detail
When users attempt to exercise their options to purchase ve and stake lp tokens, they use the [`exerciseVe`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L286) and [`exerciseLp`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L305) functions. The functions hold the `_maxPaymentAmount` which protects the user from slippage in terms of maximum amount of options tokens they can spend. However, these functions still interact with a router to return a desired `lpAmount` which either used to [create a lock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L640) for the `recipient` in the VotingEscrow in the case of `_exerciseVe` or [staked](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/OptionTokenV4.sol#L700) in the Gauge in the case of `_exerciseLp`. 
This interaction with the router is performed with improperly hardcoded `amountAMin` and `amountBMin` for both tokens, and also block.timestamp as deadline, meaning that over the amount of `pair` that is minted to the router and staked for them as liquidity, regardless of how much options they had burned, which opens them up to being sandwiched or frontrun by other malicious users or MEV bots.

In `_exerciseVe`, the minimum values are hardcoded as 1 and deadline is set as block.timestamp. 
```solidity
    function _exerciseVe(
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _maxPaymentAmount,
        uint256 _discount,
        address _recipient
    ) internal returns (uint256 paymentAmount, uint256 nftId,uint256 lpAmount) {
...
        // Create Lp for users
        _safeApprove(underlyingToken, router, _amount);
        _safeApprove(paymentToken, router, paymentAmountToAddLiquidity);
        (, , lpAmount) = IRouter(router).addLiquidity(
            underlyingToken,
            paymentToken,
            false,
            _amount,
            paymentAmountToAddLiquidity,
            1,
            1,
            address(this),
            block.timestamp
        );
...
    }
```
THe same can be observed in `_exerciseLp` too.
```solidity
    function _exerciseLp(
        uint256 _amount,   // the oTOKEN amount the user wants to redeem with
        uint256 _maxPaymentAmount, // the 
        address _recipient,
        uint256 _discount
    ) internal returns (uint256 paymentAmount, uint256 lpAmount) {
        ...
        // Create Lp for users
        _safeApprove(underlyingToken, router, _amount);
        _safeApprove(paymentToken, router, paymentAmountToAddLiquidity);
        (, , lpAmount) = IRouter(router).addLiquidity(
            underlyingToken,
            paymentToken,
            false,
            _amount,
            paymentAmountToAddLiquidity,
            1,
            1,
            address(this),
            block.timestamp
        );
...
```

This means that regardless of how much option tokens the user burns, the amount of liquidity that is eventually staked for them can be as little as just 1 token, which is not ideal. 

## Impact

Loss of funds and delayed transaction in the mempool due to improperly hardcoded parameters.

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation

Recommend either allowing the users to set the minimum amount out paramters, or using a more reasonable value. For instance, a certain percentage of the `_amount` and `paymentAmountToAddLiquidity` can be set as minimum.
