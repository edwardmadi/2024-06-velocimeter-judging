# Users might lose their voting power.

## Summary
Users might unexpectedly use only a portion of their voting power.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Voter` contract, `_totalVoteWeight` is calculated as follows.
```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < _poolCnt; i++) {
    _totalVoteWeight += _weights[i];
}
```
But, in reality, `_weights[i]` is only used for active `gauges`.
```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < _poolCnt; i++) {
    address _pool = _poolVote[i];
    address _gauge = gauges[_pool];

    if (isGauge[_gauge]) {
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");
        uint256 _poolWeight = _weights[i] * _weight / _totalVoteWeight;
        require(votes[_tokenId][_pool] == 0);
        require(_poolWeight != 0);
        _updateFor(_gauge);

        poolVote[_tokenId].push(_pool);

        weights[_pool] += _poolWeight;
        votes[_tokenId][_pool] += _poolWeight;
        IBribe(external_bribes[_gauge])._deposit(uint256(_poolWeight), _tokenId);
        _usedWeight += _poolWeight;
        _totalWeight += _poolWeight;
        emit Voted(msg.sender, _tokenId, _poolWeight);
    }
}
if (_usedWeight > 0) IVotingEscrow(_ve).voting(_tokenId);
totalWeight += uint256(_totalWeight);
usedWeights[_tokenId] = uint256(_usedWeight);
```
So, `_usedWeight` might only be a portion of `_weight`, which is not desirable.
## Impact
Users might unexpectedly use part of their voting power, which can result in a loss of potential profit.

## Recommendation
```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < _poolCnt; i++) {
-    _totalVoteWeight += _weights[i];
+    if (isGauge[_gauge]) {
+        _totalVoteWeight += _weights[i];
+    }
}
```
