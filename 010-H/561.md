# killGaugeTotally() needs to reduce totalWeight

## Summary
After `killGaugeTotally()` is executed, `totalWeight` is not subtracted from `weights[pool]`.
After that, `index` is still calculated using the old `totalWeight`, resulting in `index` always being small. 
## Vulnerability Detail
in `killGaugeTotally()` 
The `totalWeight` does not reduce the corresponding `weights[_pool]`.
```solidity
    function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugeKillAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Restart gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");

        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];

        delete isAlive[_gauge];
        delete external_bribes[_gauge];
        delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
        delete isGauge[_gauge];
        delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
@>      //@audit miss reduce totalWeight
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

        killedGauges.push(_gauge);

        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }
```
But in `notifyRewardAmount()` it still uses the old `totalWeight`.
`index += amount * 1e18 / totalWeight`

The killed `gauge` is not able to get the reward, so this part of the token will always be lost
```solidity
    function _updateFor(address _gauge) internal {
...
                if (isAlive[_gauge]) {
                    claimable[_gauge] += _share;
                }
```

## Impact

A smaller `index` will cause this part of the rewards to be unavailable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. in `killGaugeTotally()` :  totalWeight -= weights[poolForGauge[_gauge]]
2. in `_reset()` : If `isAlive [_gauge] = false` does not reduce  `totalWeight`
