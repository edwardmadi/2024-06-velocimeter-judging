# Rewards are diluted by paused or killed Gauges that still possess weights assigned to them from previous voting, and these rewards are locked forever in the `Voter` contract.

## Summary

Rewards for paused or killed Gauges continue to accumulate in the `Voter` contract and are thus lost or locked forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the `weights` and `totalWeight` values are not updated, the rewards for other Gauges are diluted by the amount of votes still remaining in `totalWeight`.

The weights are only updated when a user who voted for a paused or killed Gauge resets their vote. While this might be acceptable, there is a further issue.

All shares (rewards) that accumulate for such paused or killed Gauges are lost and locked forever in the Voter contract:

```solidity
File: Voter.sol
525:             if (_delta > 0) {
526:                 uint _share = uint(_supplied) * _delta / 1e18;
527:                 if (isAlive[_gauge]) {
528:                     claimable[_gauge] += _share;
529:                 } // <== no else case here, rewards should be at least returned back to Minter 
530:             }
```

## Impact

Loss of funds in the form of rewards that are still calculated for paused or killed Gauges.

## Recommendation

Return the calculated `_share` amount back to the `Minter` contract if the Gauge is paused or killed and still has votes in its balance in the `weights` mapping.
