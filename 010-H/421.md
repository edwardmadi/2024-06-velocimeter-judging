# Killing a Gauge Could Result in Stuck Funds

## Summary
Killing a gauge in Voter leaves its vote weight in the total, causing its reward portion to remain unused and stuck in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a gauge is killed using the `killGaugeTotally` function in the Voter contract, the gauge-related data is cleared. 

However, if the gauge was already voted for, its vote weight has been added to the period's `totalWeight`. This total weight is not adjusted when a gauge is killed, causing the portion of the reward committed to that gauge to remain unused and get stuck in the contract.

## Impact
Rewards will get stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function killGaugeTotally(address _gauge) external {
        if (msg.sender != emergencyCouncil) {
            require(
                IGaugePlugin(gaugePlugin).checkGaugeKillAllowance(msg.sender, _gauge)
            , "Restart gauge not allowed");
        }
        require(isAlive[_gauge], "gauge already dead");

        address _pool = poolForGauge[_gauge];

        delete isAlive[_gauge];
        delete external_bribes[_gauge];
        delete poolForGauge[_gauge];
        delete isGauge[_gauge];
@>>     delete claimable[_gauge];
        delete supplyIndex[_gauge];
        delete gauges[_pool];
        try IPair(_pool).setHasGauge(false) {} catch {}

        killedGauges.push(_gauge);

        emit GaugeKilledTotally(_gauge);
    }
```
