# Lack of the access control in the `Voter::detachTokenFromGauge` function

## Summary

[Voter::detachTokenFromGauge](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L444) function has the ability to detach certain tokens from the gauge and it is supposed to be called by privileged accounts, however the access control is missing and anyone can detach other user's token from the gauge.

## Vulnerability Detail

[Voter::detachTokenFromGauge](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/63818925987a5115a80eff4bd12578146a844cfd/v4-contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L444) function is as follows:

```solidity

File: Voter.sol
444: function detachTokenFromGauge(uint tokenId, address account) external { // @audit should check the caller
445:         if (tokenId > 0) IVotingEscrow(_ve).detach(tokenId);
446:         emit Detach(account, msg.sender, tokenId);
447:     }

File: VotingEscrow.sol
1190: function detach(uint _tokenId) external {
1191:         require(msg.sender == voter);
1192:         attachments[_tokenId] = attachments[_tokenId] - 1;
1193:     }

```

As evident from the above code snippet, anyone can call this function for detaching tokens of other user's from the corresponding gauge as well as their tokens.

Hence it will affect several factor of the protocol, since the attachments check is used in several parts of the protocol like `_transferFrom`, `withdraw`, `merge` and `split`.


## Impact

Anyone can detach token from the gauges and it will cause unintended behaviour in several factors of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add a check in the `Voter::detachTokenFromGauge` as follows:

```diff

File: Voter.sol
444:    function detachTokenFromGauge(uint tokenId, address account) external { 
+            require(isGauge[msg.sender]);
+            require(isAlive[msg.sender]);   
445:         if (tokenId > 0) IVotingEscrow(_ve).detach(tokenId); 
446:         emit Detach(account, msg.sender, tokenId);
447:     }


```
