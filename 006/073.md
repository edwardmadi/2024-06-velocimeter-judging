# Inconsistent Token Detachment in Gauge Withdrawal

## Summary
The GaugeV4 contract has an inconsistency in its withdrawal logic that can lead to tokens remaining attached to the gauge when they should be detached. This occurs due to different behavior between the withdraw and withdrawToken functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the withdraw function, there's logic to detach the token from the gauge if the user is withdrawing their entire balance:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/GaugeV4.sol#L505-L511

However, the withdrawToken function, which can be called directly, doesn't have this check:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/GaugeV4.sol#L536-L542

This means that if a user calls withdrawToken directly with their full balance but without providing a tokenId, their token will not be detached from the gauge.

## Impact
This inconsistency can lead to tokens remaining attached to the gauge when they should be detached. This could potentially interfere with the correct functioning of the voting and reward distribution mechanisms, as the system may still consider these tokens as part of the gauge when they should not be.

## Code Snippet
POC:
```solidity
function testInconsistentTokenDetachment() public {
    vm.startPrank(address(owner));
    washTrades();
    flowDaiPair.approve(address(gauge), 1000);

    // Deposit with a tokenId
    gauge.deposit(1000, 1);
    assertEq(gauge.tokenIds(address(owner)), 1);

    // Withdraw full balance using withdrawToken
    gauge.withdrawToken(1000, 0);
    
    // Check that the token is still attached
    assertEq(gauge.tokenIds(address(owner)), 1);

    // Reset
    gauge.deposit(1000, 1);

    // Withdraw full balance using withdraw
    gauge.withdraw(1000);
    
    // Check that the token is now detached
    assertEq(gauge.tokenIds(address(owner)), 0);

    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, consider modifying the withdrawToken function to always detach the token if the user is withdrawing their entire balance, regardless of whether a tokenId was provided:
```solidity
function withdrawToken(uint amount, uint tokenId) public lock {
    // ... (other code)
    if (amount == balanceOf[msg.sender]) {
        tokenId = tokenIds[msg.sender];
        if (tokenId > 0) {
            tokenIds[msg.sender] = 0;
            IVoter(voter).detachTokenFromGauge(tokenId, msg.sender);
        }
    } else if (tokenId > 0) {
        require(tokenId == tokenIds[msg.sender]);
        tokenIds[msg.sender] = 0;
        IVoter(voter).detachTokenFromGauge(tokenId, msg.sender);
    }
    // ... (other code)
}
```
