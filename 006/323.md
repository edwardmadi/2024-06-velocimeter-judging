# `detachGauge(...)` is missing access control

## Summary
The function `detachTokenFromGauge(...)` in `Voter.sol` is missing access control, leading to inconsistency across the protocol and potentially causing reverts of withdrawals from the gauge.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `detachTokenFromGauge(...)` function lacks access control to ensure that `msg.sender` is an active gauge.

```solidity
function detachTokenFromGauge(uint tokenId, address account) external { // @audit-issue no access control, no check that caller is alive gauge
    if (tokenId > 0) IVotingEscrow(_ve).detach(tokenId);
    emit Detach(account, msg.sender, tokenId);
}
```

The correct access control logic can be observed in the `attachTokenToGauge(...)` function:

```solidity
function attachTokenToGauge(uint tokenId, address account) external {
    require(isGauge[msg.sender]);
    require(isAlive[msg.sender]); // killed gauges cannot attach tokens to themselves
    if (tokenId > 0) IVotingEscrow(_ve).attach(tokenId);
    emit Attach(account, msg.sender, tokenId);
}
```

The function above demonstrates that `attachTokenToGauge(...)` should only be called by an active gauge.

When a token is attached, it should not be transferable, as indicated in the `_transferFrom(...)` internal function of `VotingEscrow.sol`:

```solidity
require(attachments[_tokenId] == 0 && !voted[_tokenId], "attached");
```

The lack of access control breaks many invariants and can cause withdrawal reverts within the gauge due to potential arithmetic underflows when trying to decrease `attachment` that may already be zero due to this issue:

```solidity
// GaugeV4.sol 
function withdrawToken(...) public lock {
// ...
    if (tokenId > 0) {
        require(tokenId == tokenIds[msg.sender]);
        tokenIds[msg.sender] = 0;
        IVoter(voter).detachTokenFromGauge(tokenId, msg.sender); // @audit-issue could potentially revert
    } else {
        tokenId = tokenIds[msg.sender];
    }
}
```

## Impact
The application's invariants state that when a token is attached, it should not be transferred or merged. However, due to the missing access control, this invariant can be violated. Additionally, withdrawals from the gauge may revert due to arithmetic underflows.

## Recommendation
Consider allowing only gauges to detach tokens from a gauge, similar to the `attachTokenToGauge(...)` function.
