# Users will be unable to withdraw NFTs after removing all liquidity (`GaugeV4::withdrawToken`)

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `GaugeV4` contract implements a staking mechanism where users can deposit liquidity and attach veNFTs  to their positions. The [`withdrawToken()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/GaugeV4.sol#L513-L555) is designed to allow users to withdraw their staked tokens and, if applicable, detach their veNFTs from the gauge. However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of `withdrawToken()`.

The function attempts to detach the NFT token even when the withdrawal amount is zero, which can occur when a user has already removed all their liquidity. This leads to a scenario where users who have withdrawn all their liquidity are unable to retrieve their NFTs, effectively locking these assets in the contract.

The root cause of this issue lies in the following code snippet from the [`withdrawToken()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/GaugeV4.sol#L513-L555):

```solidity
if (tokenId > 0) {
    require(tokenId == tokenIds[msg.sender]);
    tokenIds[msg.sender] = 0;
    IVoter(voter).detachTokenFromGauge(tokenId, msg.sender);
} else {
    tokenId = tokenIds[msg.sender];
}
```

This code attempts to detach the token regardless of the `amount` being withdrawn. When a user has already withdrawn all their liquidity and tries to retrieve their NFT, the `amount` will be zero, but the function will still attempt to detach the token, leading to unexpected behavior and potential loss of access to the NFT.

## Impact
Users who have removed all their liquidity from the gauge will be unable to withdraw their NFTs, resulting in these assets being permanently locked in the contract. This not only prevents users from accessing their rightful assets but also undermines the intended functionality of the gauge system. The impact is significant as it directly affects user assets and trust in the protocol.

## Proof of Concept
1. Alice deposits 100 tokens into the gauge and attaches her NFT (tokenId = 1).
2. Alice withdraws all 100 tokens from the gauge using `withdrawToken(100, 0)`.
3. Alice attempts to withdraw her NFT using `withdrawToken(0, 1)`.
4. The function executes but fails to properly detach the NFT due to the zero amount.
5. Alice's NFT remains locked in the contract, and she cannot retrieve it.

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, add a check to ensure that the `amount` is greater than zero before attempting to detach the token from the gauge. This will prevent the NFT from being locked in the contract when the position has zero liquidity.

Here's the recommended fix:

```diff
function withdrawToken(uint amount, uint tokenId) public lock {
    // ... existing code ...

-    if (tokenId > 0) {
+    if (tokenId > 0 && amount > 0) {
        require(tokenId == tokenIds[msg.sender]);
        tokenIds[msg.sender] = 0;
        IVoter(voter).detachTokenFromGauge(tokenId, msg.sender);
    } else {
        tokenId = tokenIds[msg.sender];
    }

    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```

This change ensures that the NFT is only detached when there is actually liquidity being withdrawn, preventing the locking of NFTs in zero-liquidity scenarios.
