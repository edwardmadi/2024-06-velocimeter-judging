# `Voter`::`detachTokenFromGauge()` lacks of access control

## Summary

In `Voter` contract, `detachTokenFromGauge()` function lacks an access control which results anyone can detach token from gauge.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

Anyone can call `detachTokenFromGauge()` to detach a token.Should only be a gauge.
