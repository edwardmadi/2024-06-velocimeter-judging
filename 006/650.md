# Missing check if the caller is the gauge in detachTokenFromGauge function leads to unable to withdraw tokens in GaugeV4.withdrawToken

## Summary
The `detachTokenFromGauge` function in the `Voter` contract does not check if the caller is the gauge, leading to an inability to withdraw tokens in the `GaugeV4.withdrawToken` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `detachTokenFromGauge` function is intended to detach a token from a gauge.
However, the function does not check if the caller is the gauge, which is required to detach the token.
Anyone can call this function to make a `attachments[_tokenId]` to 0.
When user call `withdrawToken` in `GaugeV4` contract, it will call to `detachTokenFromGauge` function to detach the token from the gauge.
But it's not possible to detach the token because the `attachments[_tokenId]` is 0.

## Impact
The inability to withdraw tokens from the `GaugeV4` contract due to the `attachments[_tokenId]` being set to 0 by an unauthorized caller.

## Recommendation
Add a check in the `detachTokenFromGauge` function to ensure that the caller is the gauge, allowing the token to be detached successfully.
