# Miscalculation of Voting Power in the function `balanceOfNFTAt`

## Summary
The `balanceOfNFTAt` function in the `VotingEscrow` contract retrieves the voting power of a specific tokenId at a given timestamp `_t`. This function is essential for determining voting power at past timestamps for snapshot-based voting.

However, the function incorrectly calculates voting power for timestamps in the past.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function has an error in calculating voting power for past timestamps. Specifically, when `_t` (the current time) is before the user's last checkpoint (`lastPoint.ts`), the calculation improperly increases the voting power (`bias`). 

```solidity
lastPoint.bias -= lastPoint.slope * int128(int256(_t) - int256(lastPoint.ts));
```

This results in users who staked after the snapshot timestamp being incorrectly granted voting power, which goes against the intended logic that only tokens staked before the snapshot should count. 

> The miscalculation means that the later a user stakes, the more their voting power is incorrectly increased, due to the subtraction of a negative number.

## POC
```solidity
function test_votingPower() public {
    flowDaiPair.approve(address(escrow), TOKEN_1);

    vm.warp(86400 * 365);
    console.log("Block.Timestamp", block.timestamp);

    uint tokenId0 = escrow.create_lock(1 ether, 20 weeks);

    uint snapshot = block.timestamp - 3 weeks;
    console.log("Snapshot: ", snapshot);

    uint votingPower = escrow.balanceOfNFTAt(tokenId0, snapshot);
    console.log(votingPower);

}
```
Output:
```solidity
[PASS] test_votingPower() (gas: 503458)
Logs:
  Block.Timestamp 31536000
  Snapshot:  29721600
  439560439547904000
  ```
## Impact
- Users who stake following a snapshot could be incorrectly awarded voting power for that snapshot, allowing them to affect the vote's outcome even though they are not eligible to participate.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _balanceOfNFT(uint _tokenId, uint _t) internal view returns (uint) {
        uint _epoch = user_point_epoch[_tokenId];
        if (_epoch == 0) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            Point memory last_point = user_point_history[_tokenId][_epoch];
@>       last_point.bias -= last_point.slope * int128(int256(_t) - int256(last_point.ts));
            if (last_point.bias < 0) {
                last_point.bias = 0;
            }
            return uint(int256(last_point.bias));
        }
    }

    function balanceOfNFTAt(uint _tokenId, uint _t) external view returns (uint) {
@>     return _balanceOfNFT(_tokenId, _t);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Do Binary search to get the user point index for a token id at or prior to a given timestamp. If a user point does not exist prior to the timestamp return 0.
