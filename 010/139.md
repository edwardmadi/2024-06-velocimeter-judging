# Users will receive incorrect rewards due to outdated total supply caching in `RewardsDistributorV2::_checkpoint_total_supply()`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`RewardsDistributorV2`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L134-L140) contract is responsible for distributing rewards to users based on their token holdings over time. It utilizes a checkpointing mechanism to track the total supply of tokens at regular intervals, which is then used in reward calculations. The contract includes several key functions:

1. [`_checkpoint_total_supply()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L142-L163): An internal function that updates the total supply of tokens at specific time intervals.
2. [`_claim()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L169-L224): A function that calculates and distributes rewards for a given token ID.
3. [`claim()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L282-L294) and [`claim_many()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L296-L318): External functions that allow users to claim their rewards.

The core issue lies in the [`_checkpoint_total_supply()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L142-L163) function. This function caches the total supply of tokens in the `ve_supply` array at weekly intervals:

```solidity
function _checkpoint_total_supply() internal {
    // ... (code omitted for brevity)
    for (uint i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        if (t > rounded_timestamp) {
            break;
        } else {
            uint epoch = _find_timestamp_epoch(ve, t);
            IVotingEscrow.Point memory pt = IVotingEscrow(ve).point_history(epoch);
            int128 dt = 0;
            if (t > pt.ts) {
                dt = int128(int256(t - pt.ts));
            }
            ve_supply[t] = Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt)), 0);
        }
        t += WEEK;
    }
    time_cursor = t;
}
```

The problem arises when there are significant changes in the total supply between these weekly checkpoints. For instance, if a large amount of tokens is locked or unlocked shortly after a checkpoint, the cached value in `ve_supply` will not reflect this change until the next checkpoint.

This outdated information is then used in the reward calculation process within the [`_claim()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-velocimeter/blob/main/v4-contracts/contracts/RewardsDistributorV2.sol#L169-L224) function:

```solidity
@>   to_distribute += balance_of * tokens_per_week[week_cursor] / ve_supply[week_cursor];
```

As a result, users can receive more or fewer rewards than they are entitled to, depending on whether the actual total supply has increased or decreased since the last checkpoint.

## Impact
The caching of outdated total supply values leads to incorrect reward distributions among users. Some users may receive more rewards than they should, while others receive less, creating an unfair advantage for certain participants. This discrepancy undermines the integrity of the reward system and can be exploited by users who are aware of the issue.

The impact is particularly severe when there are large changes in the total supply between checkpoints, as this will result in the most significant discrepancies in reward calculations. Over time, this could lead to substantial financial losses for the protocol and erode trust in the fairness of the reward distribution mechanism.

## Proof of Concept
1. At time T, the total supply is checkpointed at 1,000,000 tokens.
2. Shortly after T, Alice locks an additional 1,000,000 tokens, doubling the actual total supply to 2,000,000.
3. Bob, who holds 100,000 tokens (10% of the original supply, but only 5% of the new supply), claims his rewards.
4. The `_claim()` function uses the outdated total supply of 1,000,000 from `ve_supply[week_cursor]`.
5. Bob receives 10% of the rewards for that period instead of the 5% he should actually receive based on the current total supply.
6. This process continues until the next checkpoint, allowing Bob to claim excessive rewards at the expense of other users like Alice.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, it's recommended to avoid caching the total supply and instead fetch it directly from the `voting_escrow` contract when needed for calculations. This ensures that the most up-to-date total supply is always used in reward distributions.

Here's a suggested modification to the `_claim()` function:

```diff
function _claim(uint _tokenId, address ve, uint _last_token_time) internal returns (uint) {
    // ... (existing code)
    for (uint i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        // ... (existing code)
        if (balance_of != 0) {
-           to_distribute += balance_of * tokens_per_week[week_cursor] / ve_supply[week_cursor];
+           uint current_supply = IVotingEscrow(ve).totalSupply(week_cursor);
+           to_distribute += balance_of * tokens_per_week[week_cursor] / current_supply;
        }
        // ... (existing code)
    }
    // ... (existing code)
}
```
