# Checkpointing total supply when `block.timestamp % WEEK == 0` will result in overdistribution of rewards

## Summary
Checkpointing total supply when `block.timestamp % WEEK == 0` will result in overdistribution of rewards

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, in order to checkpoint a week's total supply, `checkpoint_total_supply` has to be called when/after a new week begins.

```solidity
    function _checkpoint_total_supply() internal {
        address ve = voting_escrow;
        uint t = time_cursor;
        uint rounded_timestamp = block.timestamp / WEEK * WEEK;
        IVotingEscrow(ve).checkpoint();

        for (uint i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            if (t > rounded_timestamp) {
                break;
            } else {
                uint epoch = _find_timestamp_epoch(ve, t);
                IVotingEscrow.Point memory pt = IVotingEscrow(ve).point_history(epoch);
                int128 dt = 0;
                if (t > pt.ts) {
                    dt = int128(int256(t - pt.ts));
                }
                ve_supply[t] = Math.max(uint(int256(pt.bias - pt.slope * dt)), 0);
            }
            t += WEEK;
        }
        time_cursor = t;
    }

```

The problem is that this allows checkpointing the total supply at the exact timestamp  where new week begins. After the total supply is checkpointed, if any user increase/create locks, this will result in actual higher total supply. All of the newly created locks will be eligible for rewards.

## Impact
Overdistribution of rewards. Last people to attempt to claim rewards will not be able to.

## Recommendation
```diff
        for (uint i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
-            if (t > rounded_timestamp) {
+            if (t >= rounded_timestamp) {
                break;
```
