# Options price is always lower than what it really should be.

## Summary
Options price is always lower than what it really should be.

## Vulnerability Detail
When exercising options, the way they're priced is by using the `TWAP` of 4 `amountsOut` in consecutive time periods.

```solidity
    function getTimeWeightedAveragePrice(
        uint256 _amount
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256[] memory amtsOut = IPair(pair).prices(
            underlyingToken,
            _amount,
            twapPoints
        );
        uint256 len = amtsOut.length;
        uint256 summedAmount;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            summedAmount += amtsOut[i];
        }

        return summedAmount / twapPoints;
    }
```

The problem is that when swapping tokenA for tokenB, the amount we receive (`amountOut` ) is always at a worse tokenA/tokenB price and hence the received amount is less than what it should be in reality.

As this "received" amount is the user's `paymentAmount` and is less than what it really should be, it results in users always paying less for options than supposed to.

## Recommendation
Simply use the price and not the `amountsOut`
